The dragon and the two beasts in the book of Revelation are usually interpreted in a very abstract (evil forces) or very “creative” way. Who are they really?

## The context of the first readers

<a name="2f6a"></a>
The key to understanding the dragon and the two beasts is to see the aspect of the {{% int_link val="book as a letter" link="/expl/background/literature/the-book-of-revelation-how-to-read-it" %}} which should give us some clues as to the meaning of the {{% bible val="two beasts in Revelation" link="rev:13" lang="en" %}}.

The two beasts coming up out of the sea and out of the earth are based on

- {{% bible val="Behemoth" link="job:40,15-24" lang="en" %}} (the beast from the earth), which is {{% bible val="slain by God with a sword in Job" link="job:40,19" lang="en" %}} and is also {{% bible val="wounded by a sword in Revelation" link="rev:13,14" lang="en" %}}, and
- {{% bible val="Leviathan " link="job:41" lang="en" %}}(the beast from the sea), which has {{% bible val="flames coming out of its mouth" link="job:41,19" lang="en" %}}.

These beast {{% bible val="are subdued by God" link="job:7,12" lang="en" %}} and expected in the Jewish tradition, as also in {{% bible val="Isaiah" link="isa:27,1" lang="en" %}}, it is expected that God will conquer them in the end times.

Both beasts are no match for human beings, but {{% bible val="even a toy for God" link="psa:104,26" lang="en" %}}.

The first readers saw whatever came “out of the sea” as foreign, which at that time was the emperor in Rome or the governors who all came out of the sea via Ephesus, as there are ships that look like they come out of the sea when they appear on the horizon.

“From the earth” would be as native political and economic authorities.

## The dragon

<a name="bb06"></a>
He is very clear to understand. He is the devil. He is the puppet master behind everything and the true origin of evil because {{% bible val="we are not fighting against flesh and blood" link="eph:6,12" lang="en" %}}. He is not really in power but he drives the powers on earth.

## The first beast

<a name="1c08"></a>
This is the emperor in Rome (from the sea). He is no different from all the rulers before him. And with the end of a particular emperor (death of Nero, Tiberius, …) the first beast is not dead. {{% bible val="With each new emperor, it comes back to life. Rome is unbeatable." link="rev:13,3-4" lang="en" %}}

{{% bible val="Rome blasphemes God" link="rev:13,4-6" lang="en" %}} by {{% int_link val="claiming to be like Him" link="/expl/background/history/pax-romana-key-to-understand-the-book-of-revelation" %}}. The emperor is the one who commands the Roman legions and breaks anyone who does not play along. {{% bible val="He starts persecutions against God’s people and is successful with it" link="rev:13,7-8" lang="en" %}}. And all who are written in the book of life will bow their knees before him, for {{% bible val="he has the power and the saints can only endure" link="rev:13,10" lang="en" %}}.

## The second beast

<a name="2f0d"></a>
This is a wide network of people who benefit from emperor’s favor. This could be tax breaks, financial support, or something else. For them the {{% int_link val="emperor is a guarantee for the god’s blessings" link="/expl/background/history/pax-romana-key-to-understand-the-book-of-revelation" %}}.

They make {{% bible val="sure that no one does anything to lose the favor of the emperor" link="rev:13,12" lang="en" %}}. They perform processions, build temples, work in and for the temples, sell meat dedicated to the idols, attend feasts for the idols and much more. It is a comprehensive activity. {{% bible val="It does not look evil: “Just go with the flow”." link="rev:13,11" lang="en" %}}

The follower of the emperor seems to be the {{% bible val="only one in power and he can give life and provision and is unquestioned." link="rev:13,13-14" lang="en" %}}

But how can the statue created by the second beast speak? If we look at the parallel in {{% bible val="the book Daniel" link="dan:3,4-12" lang="en" %}}, where the ear and eyes of the statue or jealous officials. This is also the case here. The {{% bible val="idol gets its power from the people who support it" link="rev:13,15" lang="en" %}}.

The people receive a mark on their hands and foreheads. In the Old Testament this was a {{% bible val="picture of the remembrance of the power of God" link="exo:13,16" lang="en" %}} that causes loyalty: Don’t forget what you have seen here. For God, it was the plagues in Egypt and the Exodus; for the devil, it is the system that you cannot defeat.

If you do not fall in, you {{% bible val="will be financially ruined " link="rev:13,16-17" lang="en" %}}.

## What to do?

<a name="0a91"></a>
What can Christians do to confront this system. The answer is given, for example in chapter 14: They are faithful to God and don’t compromise which is stated {{% bible val="because they are virgins" link="rev:14,4" lang="en" %}}. In chapter 13 this is the loyalty {{% bible val="described by worship" link="rev:13,8" lang="en" %}}.

And in all of this: {{% bible val="Perseverance" link="rev:13,10" lang="en" %}} and {{% bible val="wisdom as to God and what is not" link="rev:13,18" lang="en" %}}.
