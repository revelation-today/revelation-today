What does a dead church look like? How do you inject new life into it? Curious? Check out the {{% bible val="letter to Sardis" link="rev:3,1-6" lang="en" %}}.

## The historical background

<a name="bf90"></a>
Sardis has the longest history of all. The city is perfectly situated in terms of climate (it'son the edge of a mountain range and located inside a fertile valley).

The city was always of great importance. For example, when it was destroyed by a massive earthquake in 17 BC, it was rebuilt under the leadership of the Emperor, 
and nine years later the city applied out of gratitude for this for the construction of a temple in honor of the Emperor.

The city was a natural fortress because it was 500 meters above the sea level, surrounded by rocks, yet not connected to mountains. 
Because of the location, the city overestimated itself.
Yet enemies conquered it twice by gaining access through places that were considered impregnable.

## Jesus’s view

<a name="87a6"></a>
Jesus {{% bible val="approached the church in the full power of the Spirit and reminded them of their call to be light to the world" link="rev:3,1" lang="en" %}}.

There is little praise for this church only a few of the believers are blameless.

There is a great deal of cencure: The church is dead, its works are not complete, and it must act quickly if is wants to be purposeful. What is the problem?

## The problem

<a name="8872"></a>
The main problem is their false self-importance. The overestimation of the city's impregnable state has rubbed off on them, they think they can be a church without the power of the Holy Spirit.

The reference {{% bible val="to being dead and awakening what is about to die" link="rev:3,1-2" lang="en" %}} has a strong connection to the 
{{% bible val="vision of the valley of dry bones in Ezekiel, where the Holy Spirit comes and breathes in new life" link="ezk:37" lang="en" %}}.

Also, the reference to “{{% bible val="found your deeds incomplete in the sight of God" link="rev:3,2" lang="en" %}}” is a reminder that “{{% bible val="all complete work comes from God, the Father of lights" link="jas:1,17" lang="en" %}}”.

Life without the Holy Spirit is not sustainable. The church at Sardis should act quickly, or the Lord's return will take them by surprise.

## The promise

White robes are a sign of acquittal in a court.

The fact that their names are not blotted out of the Book of Life means that they do not lose their citizenship in heaven. 
However, this is only for those who repent. 

This is a wake-up call! It's purpose is to shock them into action.
