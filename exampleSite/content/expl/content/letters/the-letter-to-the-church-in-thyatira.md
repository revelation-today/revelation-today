What do you do in a church where the problem is leadership? Right, you read the letter to the church in Thyatira!

The {{% bible val="letter to this church is the longest letter" link="rev:2,18-29" lang="en" %}}, and it is for (probably) the smallest church.

## The historical background

<a name="244a"></a>
The city was possibly a military outpost of Pergamon and was located 70 km southeast of Pergamon.

In the time of the Book of Revelation, the city was known for its purple dye factory and bronze work. 
Therefore, the city had a guild which held a regular feast in honor of the patron of the guild. 
The feasts were only for mean but this celebration encouraged sexual immorality as it included girls as part of the entertainment.

## Jesus’s view

<a name="b87c"></a>
Jesus approaches the city as the Son of God with eyes like blazing fire and feet like furnished bronze. 
This calls to mind {{% bible val="the story of Daniel’s friends in the fiery furnace" link="dan:3" lang="en" %}} where someone {{% bible val="like the son of the gods" link="dan:3,25" lang="en" %}} helped them.

He is full of praise {{% bible val="for their deeds, their love (where Ephesus struggled), their faith, their perseverance and for getting better every day (continuous growth!)" link="rev:2,19" lang="en" %}}.

## The problem

<a name="2153"></a>
There is just {{% bible val="one problem: Jezebel" link="rev:2,20" lang="en" %}}. 
In the old Testament she was {{% bible val="the queen who introduced idolatry to Israel" link="1ki:16,31" lang="en" %}}. 
And here in Thyatira, she represent a leader who has introduced idolatry to the church.

At first glance the situation looks similar to Pergamon, but Thyatira's problem is more serious because it is not caused *by* the leadership, instead, the leadership itself is the problem.

The leadership has introduced idolatry, encouraged sexual immorality, and promised insight into the works of Satan.

## The solution

<a name="09f8"></a>
What should the members of the church do? Rebel? Leave the church?

The answer is to {{% bible val="cling to Jesus and be faithful" link="rev:2,24-25" lang="en" %}}. Jesus will take care of the leadership because they are accountable to Him:

- {{% bible val="All of Jesebel's followers will suffer, in the hope that they consider to repenting" link="rev:2,21-22" lang="en" %}}.
- {{% bible val="This suffering will serve as a warning to all other churches" link="rev:2,23" lang="en" %}}.

Jesus promises them authority for those who endure and remain faithful under false leadership. They will rule with a sceptre of iron ({{% bible val="Psalm 2" link="psa:2" lang="en" %}}).

The {{% bible val="morning star" link="rev:2,28" lang="en" %}} could refer to the {{% bible val="dawn of a new hope" link="2pe:1,19" lang="en" %}} in Jesus, 
who {{% bible val="is the Morning Star" link="rev:22,16" lang="en" %}}.
