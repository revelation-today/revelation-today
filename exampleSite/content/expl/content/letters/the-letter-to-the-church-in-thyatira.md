What do you do in a church where the problem is leadership? Right, you read the letter to the church in Thyatira!

The l{{% bible val="etter to this church is the longest" link="rev:2,18-29" lang="en" %}} for the probably the smallest church.

## The historical background

<a name="244a"></a>
The city was probably a military outpost of Pergamon and was located 70 km southeast of Pergamon.

In the time of the Book of Revelation, the city was known for its purple dye factory and bronze work. Therefore, the city had a guild, which included a regular feast in honor of the patron of the guild. This included girls who encouraged sexual immorality (the feasts were only for men).

## Jesus’s view

<a name="b87c"></a>
Jesus approaches the city as the Son of God with eyes like blazing fire and feet like furnished bronze. This may recall {{% bible val="the story of Daniel’s friends in the fiery furnace" link="dan:3" lang="en" %}} where someone {{% bible val="like the son of the gods" link="dan:3,25" lang="en" %}} helped them.

He is full of praise {{% bible val="for the deeds, the love (where Ephesus struggled), the faith, the perseverance and for getting better every day (continuous growth!)" link="rev:2,19" lang="en" %}}.

## The problem

<a name="2153"></a>
There is just {{% bible val="one problem: Jezebel" link="rev:2,20" lang="en" %}}. She introduced{{% bible val=" idolatry to Israel as queen" link="1ki:16,31" lang="en" %}}. And here in Thyatira she introduced idolatry as a leader.

The situation may be similar to Pergamon, but the problem here is more serious because the problem is not caused by the leadership, but the leadership is the problem in Thyatira.

The leadership introduced idolatry, encouraged sexual immorality, and promised insight into the works of Satan.

## The solution

<a name="09f8"></a>
What should the members of the church do? Rebel? Leave the church?

The answer is to {{% bible val="cling to Jesus and be faithful" link="rev:2,24-25" lang="en" %}}. Jesus will take care of the leadership because they are accountable to Him:

- {{% bible val="All of her followers will suffer, so that they reconsider to repent" link="rev:2,21-22" lang="en" %}}.
- {{% bible val="Stop the spread as a warning to all other churches" link="rev:2,23" lang="en" %}}.

For those who endure, Jesus promises them authority as those who endured under false authority and remain faithful. To rule with a scepter of iron is from {{% bible val="Psalm 2" link="psa:2" lang="en" %}}.

The {{% bible val="morning star" link="rev:2,28" lang="en" %}} could refer to the {{% bible val="dawn of a new hope" link="2pe:1,19" lang="en" %}} in Jesus, who {{% bible val="is the morning star" link="rev:22,16" lang="en" %}}.
