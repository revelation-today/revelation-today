What is Gods vision for the Church? Is it just to be saved and get to heaven?

It is more than this. His vision is that we should be a light to the world, that we should be an undisputable example for Gods character and that we should also walk in full dependency on him.

That is all. But when we look at the seven churches we see that most of them struggle - and the ones who are victorious do not look inviting to us! Why?
