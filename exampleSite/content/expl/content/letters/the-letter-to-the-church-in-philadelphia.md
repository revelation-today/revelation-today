{{% bible val="Philadelphia" link="rev:3,7-13" lang="en" %}} is the city with the key of David. What doors do this key open? Evangelism, opportunities, relationships, and/or ...? 
Read on and you will understand why this church is not chastised.

## The historical background

<a name="cca2"></a>
Philadelphia is the youngest of the seven cities and is located 50 km south of Sardis. It was probably built in the second century BC. 
The name is derived from Attalus II who succeeded his brother Eumenes as king. [He was so loyal to his brother that he was called Philadelphus ("brother loving")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attalus_II_Philadelphus).

The city, which was located at the crossroads of several trade routes, was at the end of a river basin and at the foot of a large lava area, and this made it ideal for vineyards.

The city was on a geological fault line and was constantly plagued by tremors and earthquakes. 
After a massive earthquake destroyed the city in 60 AD, Emperor Tiberius provided an aid package to rebuild the city and five year tax break while the building of the city was underway.

However, in 92 A.D. another Emperor issued a decree to reduce the cultivation of wine, allegedly to promote the cultivation of grain for the army. 
The people of Philadelphia felt betrayed by the emperor, to whom they had always been loyal.

## Jesus’ view

<a name="294f"></a>
Jesus does not rebuke the Philadelphian church.

To him, this church has David's key which can open what no one can close and close what no one can open; 
which is a {{% bible val="reference to Shebna and Eliakim" link="isa:22,15-25" lang="en" %}}. 
The key belonged to the treasury and {{% bible val="Shebna abused his position as steward it was given to Eliakim, so that he could provide for the needy" link="isa:22,21-22" lang="en" %}}.

The congregation in Philadelphia is in financial trouble; yet they are faithful to God who supports them in their needs.

Their other challenges come from the Jews who oppress this church, just as they are oppressing the church in {{% bible val="Smyrna" link="rev:2,9" lang="en" %}}. 
Jesus promises the Philadelphians that these Jews will bow down before their feet, which means that they will eventually become part of the church, and reconciliation will be necessary.

They members of the Philadelphian church are truly overcomers. What is their secret? {{% bible val="They patiently endure." link="rev:3,10" lang="en" %}}

## The promise

<a name="9039"></a>
God wants to make them like a pillar in the Temple, meaning that they will never have to leave God’s presence again and will dwell in His presence forever. 
"I will wrtie on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God" is reminiscent of {{% bible val="Ezekiel, where the name of the city is called “the LORD is here”" link="ezk:48,35" lang="en" %}}.

This promise refers to thei patient endurance over a long period of time: Their greatest desire is to be close to Jesus.

## The hour of trial

<a name="202d"></a>
Here in the letter is an interesting statement: 
“{{% bible val="Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth" link="rev:3,10" lang="en" %}}.”

What is the hour of trial and how will Jesus keep us from it? 
The Greek word translated as “[keep from](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/3-10.htm)” appears otherwise only in [the Gospel of John](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/17-15.htm), 
where Jesus prays for his disciples: “{{% bible val="My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one" link="jhn:17,15" lang="en" %}}.”. 
Jesus is not talking about taking them out of the world, but protecting them from the world, as in {{% bible val="Proverbs 7/5" link="pro:7:5" lang="en" %}} 
or the {{% bible val="Letter of James 1:27" link="jas:1,27" lang="en" %}}. Thus this statement describes the same situation as the 
{{% int_link val="Great Tribulation" link="/expl/content/army/the-end-time-and-the-great-tribulation" %}}.
