Worship is a key topic in the Book of Revelation, and it sets the scene for the start of the series of seals, trumpets and bowls.

Worship is a central theme of the book and as all the plagues origin from the place of worship, it impacts the nature of these "plagues". 
They are dispensed with mercy and passion, and will revealmore about this during the further study of the book.

Worship is also the place where the struggling churches find the answer and strength to face their battles.
