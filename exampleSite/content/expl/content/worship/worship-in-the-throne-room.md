Worship in the throne room is the answer to the letters of the churches. Why and how is this the introduction to all the plagues that follow?

## The background and context

<a name="3c72"></a>
The last verse before this chapter mentioned already the throne room of God, but there is further links to the first three chapters that addressing the situation of the church. There is the use of common phrases in both parts

These relations should give a vision for the church regarding their spiritual reality but also to follow Christ’s example. The reality that is shows in this vision is part of the reality that the church should act upon.

{{% bible val="Daniel 7" link="dan:7" lang="en" %}} has a striking parallel to chapter 4 and 5 of the Revelation:

Even there are many parallels you can easily see that the order of events are different in both passages.

This scene reminds on the angelic council as for

- {{% bible val="the calling of Isaiah" link="isa:6,1-9" lang="en" %}} or
- the {{% bible val="decision about Ahabs death" link="1ki:22,19-23" lang="en" %}}

## Why is worship the answer?

<a name="c3dc"></a>
When we look at the problems in the churches, we can categorize them as follows:

- Wrong doctrine leading to wrong behavior (Pergamon, Thyatira)
- Wrong self-evaluation leads to wrong actions (Sardis, Laodicea)
- Wrong priorities leading to meaninglessness (Ephesus)
- Risk of giving up when circumstances are too hard (Smyrna, Philadelphia)

For all of them, worship is the answer.

- When we know the original better and better, we are less influenced by false teachings.
- When we know God and worship Him as He is, we understand ourselves better and see where we need Him.
- When we find our place in relation to God, our priorities fall into place, for “If God is not first, everything else is in the wrong place.
- When we put our trust in God and walk faithfully with Him, we are not easily shaken because we have found something unshakable.

## The throne room

<a name="2a89"></a>
John’s first impression is the glory of God, which even makes it impossible to see God directly. {{% bible val="When Moses asked to see God’s glory, he could not, but instead God showed him His mercy, so God’s glory can be described as His mercy" link="exo:33,18-20" lang="en" %}}. The judgments will be from the viewpoint of mercy.

The second point is the {{% bible val="rainbow" link="rev:4,3" lang="en" %}}. {{% bible val="This is a reminder of the covenant with Noah, where God put his bow there as a promise never to flood the earth again and to keep the seasons — no demands on Noah in this covenant" link="gen:9,8-11" lang="en" %}}. This throws another light on the character in the throne room. There are judgments, but they are limited.

The last one is the {{% bible val="sea of glass" link="rev:4,6" lang="en" %}}. This has three associations:
- {{% bible val="Gods glory in heaven" link="ezk:1,22" lang="en" %}} and {{% bible val="during the the Exodus" link="exo:24,10" lang="en" %}},
- the {{% bible val="bronze sea of the Temple of Solomon" link="2ki:25,13" lang="en" %}} and
- {{% bible val="Israel’s crossing of the Red Sea in the Exodus" link="exo:15,8" lang="en" %}} 

The sea is the {{% bible val="place of evil" link="psa:74,10-17" lang="en" %}} including {{% bible val="evil people " link="isa:57,20" lang="en" %}} and the sea of glass is a picture of congealed evil.

This indicates that God is close to His people and protects them. The saints will also be there during the plagues, but God will protect them.

This is also the theme here, as you will see: Every series of plagues or announcement originates in the throne room. This is the central place in the book. Therefore, it is important to understand this place.

When we look at the coming events, we see this
- {{% int_link val="The seals have tremendous trouble, but they are there to expose Satan’s wickedness" link="/expl/content/seals/the-mystery-of-the-four-horse-men" %}}, to save as many as possible, and to come with a quick end.
- {{% int_link val="The trumpets expose the false things that people rely on, and in the fifth and sixth trumpets, the cause of the trouble is the demons that people rely on" link="/expl/content/trumpets/the-trumpets-in-revelation" %}}.
- {{% int_link val="The bowls are the place where God puts everything so that the people will not be deceived and go down with the beast in the sixth and seventh bowls." link="/expl/content/bowls/the-bowls-of-wrath" %}}

## The worship

In ancient times, the temple (which is a reflection of the heavenly throne room) is a representation of the world. God is in the center, and everything around him finds its place in relation to him.

We have the creation represented by {{% bible val="the four creatures" link="rev:4,7" lang="en" %}} inspired by {{% bible val="Ezekiel" link="ezk:1,5-21" lang="en" %}}
- Lion, the ruler of the land animals
- Ox, the strongest of the domesticated animals
- Man as the ruler of creation
- Eagle as ruler of the air

They are joined by the {{% bible val="24 elders" link="rev:4,4" lang="en" %}}, reflecting the {{% bible val="24 orders of priests" link="1ch:24,3-19" lang="en" %}}, {{% bible val="24 Levithical gatekeepers" link="1ch:26,17-19" lang="en" %}} and {{% bible val="24 permanent worshipers" link="1ch:25" lang="en" %}} introduced by David, but also the 12 tribes of Israel and the 12 apostles as the foundation of the church. This means that Israel and the Church are to be understood as one in spite of all the conflicts. The church is defined as a church of worship.
