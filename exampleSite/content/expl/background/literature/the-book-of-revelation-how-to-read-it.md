The Book of Revelation has inspired people to do many things, most of which have nothing to do with the Book of Revelation in the Bible. I will spare you a list, but I think you know what I am talking about. But how is it possible to read this very strange book? To get an answer, we must first understand the nature of this book.

The answer is not easy and requires some attention, but I think it is worth the time.

## What is the genre?

<a name="e79c"></a>
A genre is a type of literature. Depending on the genre, you would have a different approach.

- When you read a scientific work, you ask for evidence and expect nothing but truth,
- but in a poem you don’t expect that, but you might find beauty in a metaphor,
- while in a letter to you, you would expect a lot of personal references and not content unrelated to you and your specific situation.

The reason why the Book of Revelation is difficult to understand is that

- It is not just one type of literature, but 3 (letter, prophecy, and apocalyptic).
- All of these three types are not in typical use — we will come to that later.
- The type of apocalyptic work is not known to most readers and is easily misunderstood.

In the rest of this article we will focus on these three types, what they are, and what they mean when we read the book.

## A letter {#letter}

<a name="letter"></a>
Let us begin with the nature of the letter. There are many aspects that reflect the book as a letter

- {{% bible val="The formal introduction" link="rev:1,4-6" lang="en" %}} known from all the other letters in the Bible.
- {{% bible val="The formal ending" link="rev:22,21" lang="en" %}} used in many of the letters in the Bible.
- The fact that the book is intended {{% bible val="as a letter to seven churches" link="rev:1,10-11" lang="en" %}} beginning in {{% bible val="chapters 2 and 3" link="rev:2" lang="en" %}}, but with references throughout, e.g. many of the promises to the specific churches are answered in {{% bible val="chapter 21" link="rev:21" lang="en" %}}

But the book does not follow [the standard form of a letter in the Bible](https://catholic-resources.org/Bible/NT_Letters.htm). This may be due to the fact that

- it is not only a letter, but also prophetic and apocalyptic.
- it is addressed to 7 churches at the same time!

But it maintains the basic flow of a letter

- makes the church aware of who Jesus is (chapter 1)
- Addresses the basic issues and their implications (chapters 2–3)
- gives some theological explanation of how to deal with them (chapters 4–21/5)
- has some conclusions (chapters 22/6–21)

When we read the book, in chapters 4–21, we should expect a guideline on how to deal with the problems that the churches had in their specific time. This does not mean that we have different problems now, so that the answers cannot be applied, but if the majority of this book refers to parts that are only applicable in the future (even from our time), we have not considered the aspect of a letter.

## A prophecy {#prophecy}

<a name="prophecy"></a>
When people hear the word prophecy, most of them think of a supernatural glimpse into the future, mainly describing things to come.

While this is not entirely incorrect, the focus is different when it comes to the prophetic books of the Bible.

The prophetic literature in the Old Testament was based on the covenant at Mount Sinai. There God did not just give a list of rules for people to follow, but a way of thinking:

- All are equal before the law
- Have mercy on the helpless {{% bible val="as you were slaves before" link="exo:20,2" lang="en" %}}, {{% bible val="God protects the helpless" link="deu:10,18" lang="en" %}} , e.g. {{% bible val="Lev.23/22" link="lev:23,22" lang="en" %}}
- The most important law is {{% bible val="to love God and your neighbor" link="lev:19,18" lang="en" %}}, which is {{% bible val="confirmed in the New Testament and explains that everyone is our neighbor" link="luk:10,25-37" lang="en" %}}

The prophets came in play when the people did not follow this. The message had several points:

- God gave you the law and look: you have broken it (mostly by following idols, resulting in injustice to the poor).
- Therefore God will judge you (future aspect) as {{% bible val="described in the law" link="lev:26" lang="en" %}}. The intention is to train the people of God (see the {{% bible val="repeated term" link="lev:26,21" lang="en" %}} in different variants: if you still do not).
- But {{% bible val="He will have mercy on them" link="lev:26,44" lang="en" %}} especially {{% bible val="when they learn" link="lev:26,40-42" lang="en" %}}.

Thus, the main aspect of the prophetic message is to

- Comfort the oppressed
- Challenging the unjust to change their ways
- in a concrete historical situation
- and is addressed to the people of God.

This does not mean that this message is limited to the historical situation and that we could find ourselves in a similar situation.

Revelation uses many prophetic elements

- {{% bible val="Begins" link="rev:1,1-3" lang="en" %}} with an element that begins many prophetic books in the Old Testament.
- It has {{% bible val="vision with a calling" link="rev:1,9-20" lang="en" %}} as in {{% bible val="Isa.6" link="isa:6" lang="en" %}}.
- It uses references from many prophetic book. in the Old Testament like Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Zechariah, Ezekiel, …
- The book warns: get out of Babel, {{% bible val="don’t let love don’t grow cold" link="rev:2,4" lang="en" %}}, {{% bible val="don’t allow false teaching" link="rev:2,14-15" lang="en" %}}, …
- And it also comforts: {{% bible val="God’s people are protected" link="rev:7,1-4" lang="en" %}}, {{% bible val="no one will get lost" link="rev:7,5-8" lang="en" %}}, {{% bible val="God’s kingdom will surely come" link="rev:21" lang="en" %}}

The goal of a prophecy is to change the behavior and often uses emotional scenes to get a response from the reader or listener.

But there is another aspect. The point of a prophecy is that it does not come true. This sounds a bit surprising, but it becomes clear in the book {{% bible val="Jonah" link="jon:4" lang="en" %}} when Jonah refuses to prophesy against the enemies of Israel (Nineveh is the outpost of the Assyrians) because they could convert and the judgment would not come to pass, which is what happens.

It is not the standard Old Testament prophecy, as visions are often introduced with a simple “and I saw”, whereas in the Old Testament this is {{% bible val="done more elaborately" link="zec:1,7" lang="en" %}}.

## An apocalypse {#apocalypse}

<a name="apocalypse"></a>
That is the first word of the book: “Apocalypse of Jesus Christ”. This word literally means “revelation” but the direct translation is misleading because this is not a secret future telling about some event in the far or near future. It is also not about the end of the world, but about the end of the evil rulers and society. We know apocalyptic texts only from {{% bible val="Dan.7-12" link="dan:7" lang="en" %}}; {{% bible val="Mk.13" link="mrk:13" lang="en" %}}; {{% bible val="Mt.24" link="mat:24" lang="en" %}} and {{% bible val="Lk.21" link="luk:21" lang="en" %}} and we also have difficulties to understand them.

But let’s start at the beginning: Apocalypse is a genre like any other. Even if there is no complete definition of what an apocalyptic book is, there are some considerations that can help us.

The purpose of such a book is to

- encourage the people of God in a crisis, such as persecution

through

- scathing criticism of the oppressors
- passionate calls for resistance
- Trust in God’s ultimate victory over evil

This is done through [dualism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dualism)

- In time: There is an evil time now, but a better time is coming and only God can make that change.
- in character: There is a cosmic/spiritual dualism (God vs. Satan, angels vs. demons, heaven vs. hell), which causes a profane dualism (good vs. evil through alliance with God or Satan and their allies).

The intention is to force everyone to choose a side — there is no neutral ground.

Symbolic language is used to make the (dual) reality clearer and is not meant to describe the future reality but to give a spiritual insight.

The closest comparison to an apocalypse might be a political cartoon.

When we see this picture, we get the message without assuming that dragons are doing yoga or that they even exist.When we look at the book of Revelation, we see these elements.

- There is clearly an evil ruler (again, people of God), but a better time is coming with the new creation in chapter 21.
- The book has no room for compromise and is full of either ors (Lamb vs. Dragon, Jerusalem vs. Babel, seal of God vs. mark of the Beast, worshippers of God vs. worshippers of the Beast, …) that challenge the political order (not the emperor but Jesus is the true king, not the Roman peace but the Kingdom of God, not loyalty to the emperor but faith in Jesus) and its ideology.

## Conclusion {#summary}

<a name="0491"></a>
When we read the book, we must realize that it is

- A letter: it should make sense to people in the first and second centuries.
- A prophecy: it should encourage people to act differently, not in the future, but in the here and now, by giving strong emotional material.
- An apocalypse: it forces to avoid compromises and to oppose wrong rulers by describing an “either … or” world.

The book is not

- a look into the future (for the ancient listeners) to describe events in the distant future that will have no relation to them
- does not describe what the future will look like.
