Understanding what type of literature a book is, avoids a lot of missunderstandings.

Let me give you a simple example: When Paul says that Jesus is resurrected from the death, it is an undebatable truth for a Christian, but it might not be true when Jesus said there is a man going from Damaskus to Jerusalem. How can this be? Jesus himself said this. But he said before, he is telling a parable.

When we look into the book we will see that this is not a simple answer as this book is composed of three types:
- a letter - whatever is written there must be applicable for the first readers (including chapter 4-20)
- a prophecy - which purpose is not to predict, but to provoke in order to prevent the announced future, see the story of Jonah
- an apocalypse - this is not what you think it is, but a genre of provocatative resistance literature
