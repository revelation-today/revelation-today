In ancient times {{% int_link val="being in a family was essential for survival" link="/expl/background/israel/the-role-of-family-in-the-bible" %}} (provision, protection, …), and being in an important family was even better.

But how do you join a family? By marriage, by birth, by adoption and by COVENANT.

## Historical covenants

<a name="0c36"></a>
Historically, there are two types of alliances:

- between equals (military alliance, support, also called brothers)
- between the strong and the weak (conquest, called master and slave or father and son).

Let us look at the second type. This is usually the case when one country conquers another.

The stronger had authority over the land and people (he sets up a king and owns the land),

- supports the weaker with soldiers and tribute, and
- the stronger is obliged to protect the weaker.

An example is{{% bible val=" Joshua and the Gibeonites, who deceived him into making a covenant" link="jos:9" lang="en" %}}. When {{% bible val="they were attacked he had to protect them even though he did not like them" link="jos:10,1-14" lang="en" %}}.

If the weaker one broke the covenant (usually when he stopped paying tribute), he lost that land. The weaker one was not allowed to make such a covenant with others, because you can only have one father. (Covenants between several equals are possible, since you can have several brothers. A strong one can have several treaties with weaker ones, as a father can have many sons).

The Bible is full with covenants between people

- {{% bible val="Abraham and Abimelech" link="gen:21,22-32" lang="en" %}},
- {{% bible val="Isaak and the Philistines" link="gen:26,12-33" lang="en" %}},
- {{% bible val="Jacob and Laban" link="gen:31,22-54" lang="en" %}},
- {{% bible val="Gilead" link="1sa:11,1-11" lang="en" %}},
- {{% bible val="Ahab" link="1ki:20,1-34" lang="en" %}}.

“Making a covenant” literally means “cutting a covenant”. This has the following background: During the covenant ceremonies a sacrifice was offered to

- celebrate the covenant
- and to show what would happen if the covenant was broken. Often the sacrifices would be lined up and the weaker would have to go through them to show what would happen to him if he broke the covenant.

## The covenant with Abraham

<a name="d269"></a>
In the Bible the story of {{% bible val="Abraham describes such a scene" link="gen:15" lang="en" %}}. The covenant with Abraham is defined in more detail ({{% bible val="when circumcision is added" link="gen:17" lang="en" %}})

But here the foundation is given. God promises land and heirs. Then we have the sacrifice scene. The odd thing here is {{% bible val="that it is not Abraham as the weaker one who goes through the animals, but God Himself" link="gen:15,17" lang="en" %}}, so that He will carry the breaking of the covenant from Abraham’s side.

The covenant before was with {{% bible val="Noah which was one-sided" link="gen:9,8-17" lang="en" %}} (only God the stronger promised something)!

## The covenant with Israel

<a name="2225"></a>
To understand the covenant with Israel, we need some additional understanding.

When a contract was made it had a specific form

- Preamble: (often long and detailed) title and name of the stronger party.
- Prologue (only in the time of the Hittites, second millennium B.C.): shows the faithfulness and kindness of the stronger one to encourage him to join the covenant.
- Demands: what the weaker had to do
- Blessing and course: military support of the stronger or illness, removal of kings or exile of the weaker.
- Witnesses are called: usually gods of the stronger to see that the covenant is not broken.

The covenant is kept in the house of the gods of both parties and is regularly red.

This pattern is also found in the covenant that God made with Israel:

- Preambel: {{% bible val="I am the Lord your God." link="exo:20,2" lang="en" %}}
- Prologue: {{% bible val="Who brought you out of Egypt out of the land of slavery" link="exo:20,2" lang="en" %}}.
- Commandments: First (implicite): {{% bible val="Have only one God" link="exo:20,3-6" lang="en" %}}, included in the 10 Commandments.
- {{% bible val="Blessing" link="deu:28,1-14" lang="en" %}} and {{% bible val="Course" link="deu:28,15-68" lang="en" %}}: {{% bible val="consequential in exile, but gradually for education " link="lev:26,1-46" lang="en" %}}(“if you still do not listen, I will”).
- Witnesses: {{% bible val="heaven and earth" link="deu:30,19" lang="en" %}}.

The requirement to {{% bible val="read it again" link="deu:31,9-13" lang="en" %}}, even {{% bible val="for the king" link="deu:17,18-19" lang="en" %}}. There {{% bible val="was a meal together" link="exo:24,1-12" lang="en" %}}, and each party got a copy of the commandments (one tablet stays with God in the temple, the other with the God of Israel — so both in the temple — that’s why Moses had two tablets).

God also calls {{% bible val="himself the Father of Israel" link="exo:3,6" lang="en" %}}.

The Bible uses the word “heset” = “covenant loyalty” which is a word that can be described by “love”, “goodness”, “mercy” or “faithfulness”.
