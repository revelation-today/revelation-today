There was an exodus from Egypt. But when Israel failed to keep the law, they went into exile. Filled with promises of their return, when they returned from exile, they saw that nothing had changed. So the conclusion: They are still in exile, waiting for a new exodus. And that is coming with Jesus!

## The exodus in Mark

<a name="70f4"></a>
The beginning of the gospel of Mark has many references to the Exodus:

- {{% bible val="I will send my messenger" link="mrk:1,2" lang="en" %}} is a parallel to the {{% bible val="leading angel in the Exodus" link="exo:23,20" lang="en" %}} and also the {{% bible val="messenger for the Day of the Lord" link="mal:3,1" lang="en" %}}, which are a warning and judgment in case of disobedience.
- {{% bible val="A voice of one calling in the wilderness, “Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.”" link="mrk:1,3" lang="en" %}} refers to the prophecy of {{% bible val="Isaiah" link="isa:40,3" lang="en" %}}, which is a message of restoration.
- {{% bible val="“And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins." link="mrk:1,4" lang="en" %}}” is the {{% bible val="fulfillment of Elijah, preparing the new Exodus before the coming of the Day of the Lord" link="mal:4,5" lang="en" %}}.
- {{% bible val="“Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove." link="mrk:1,10" lang="en" %}}” refers to {{% bible val="Isaiah" link="isa:63,11-19" lang="en" %}}.
- {{% bible val="“And a voice came from heaven: ‘You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.’" link="mrk:1,11" lang="en" %}}” refers to the faithful servant of the Lord in Isaiah.
- {{% bible val="“After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. ‘The time has come,’ he said. ‘The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!’" link="mrk:1,14-15" lang="en" %}}” is the final {{% bible val="announcement of a new king" link="isa:52,7" lang="en" %}}.

<p>The structure in the Gospel of Mark reflects the structure of Isaiah</p>.

| Mark | Isaiah 40-66 | Explanation |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Jesus' ministry in Galilee and beyond (1/16-8/21:26) </br> People are set free by demons. </br> {{% bible val="Rejection of Jesus (Beelzebub)" link="mrk:3,22-30" lang="en" %}} results {{% bible val="in hardening of hearts" link="mrk:4,11-13" lang="en" %}}. | Israel set freed from slavery by God the Warrior and Healer</br> Israel is freed from Babel </br> {{% bible val="Rejecting God: God becomes their enemy" link="isa:63,10" lang="en" %}} | Deliverance from demons shows authority of Jesus, referring to God as the warrior who releases people from prison.</br> People are held captive by demons. |
| Mk.8/22,27-10/15,52: Jesus leads the "blind" disciples on the "way" </br> Healing the blind and deaf, disciples are also blind at first, but see again. | {{% bible val="God guides the \"blind\" on the \"way\"" link="isa:42,16" lang="en" %}} | Jesus suffering is the way in which the exodus happens (Is.53: servant goes the way through his death (Mk.10/45)) |
| Mk.10/46;11/1-16/8: Jesus eventual arrival in Jerusalem | Israel's eventual arrival in Jerusalem | Jesus veils the fig tree: reference to beginning: {{% bible val="judgment or promise, only if bears fruit" link="rev:17,14" lang="en" %}} |

## The new Exodus in Luke

<a name="1f7d"></a>
The key to the Gospel of Luke is “{{% bible val="As it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah: ‘A voice of one calling in the wilderness, “Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him. Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth. And all people will see God’s salvation.” ’" link="luk:3,4-6" lang="en" %}}”

This is the {{% bible val="same reference as the beginning of Mark" link="isa:40,2-3" lang="en" %}}.

The way is the Exodus and is God’s way of restoring Israel through the church.

When {{% bible val="Jesus read from Isaiah, he stated its fulfillment" link="luk:4,16-30" lang="en" %}}, whic{{% bible val="h was the sign of the second Exodus" link="isa:61,1-2" lang="en" %}}.

The Gospel of {{% bible val="Luke ends with the fulfillment of the Scripture" link="luk:24,44-49" lang="en" %}} that {{% bible val="refers to the restoration of Israel and the inclusion of the Gentiles in Isaiah" link="isa:49,6" lang="en" %}}.

## The new Exodus in Acts

<a name="a809"></a>
Luke uses the way 6 times in the book of Acts

- {{% bible val="during the conversion of Saul" link="act:9,2" lang="en" %}},
- {{% bible val="in Ephesus" link="act:19,9" lang="en" %}} even {{% bible val="twice" link="act:19,23" lang="en" %}},
- {{% bible val="in Paul’s speech" link="act:22,4" lang="en" %}} to the crowd in Jerusalem,
- {{% bible val="to his speech to Felix" link="act:24,14" lang="en" %}} also {{% bible val="twice" link="act:24,22" lang="en" %}}.

In the book of Acts you will also find 6 main messages of the Exodus

- Restoration of the tribes of Israel by the 12 apostles,
- {{% bible val="Pentecost included Jews from all nations" link="act:2,5" lang="en" %}}, referring to the restoration of the Jews in exile,
- The {{% bible val="coming of the Holy Spirit" link="act:2" lang="en" %}},
- {{% bible val="Restoration of Kingdom of David" link="act:15,13-18" lang="en" %}},
- {{% bible val="Inclusion of expelled to the people of God" link="act:8,28-38" lang="en" %}},
- Israel’s initial repentance at {{% bible val="Pentecost" link="act:2,41-47" lang="en" %}}, in the {{% bible val="early church" link="act:5,14" lang="en" %}}, {{% bible val="in the election of Steven" link="act:6,1-7" lang="en" %}}, in the {{% bible val="church at Antioch" link="act:11,24" lang="en" %}} and finally in chapter 12 — the {{% bible val="book ends with" link="act:28,26-27" lang="en" %}} where {{% bible val="Isaiah begins" link="isa:6,9-10" lang="en" %}}, with Israel’s rejection of the message of Jesus.

A key theme is the Word of God in the book of Acts, which spreads after the {{% bible val="election of Steven" link="act:6,7" lang="en" %}}, {{% bible val="after the death of Herod" link="act:12,24" lang="en" %}} and during {{% bible val="Paul’s time in Ephesus" link="act:19,20" lang="en" %}}, echoing important positions in Isaiah: {{% bible val="How can God be compared" link="isa:40,18-24" lang="en" %}}, he {{% bible val="is more reliable than idols" link="isa:41,4-10" lang="en" %}}, the {{% bible val="vanity of idols" link="isa:44,9-20" lang="en" %}} and {{% bible val="the idols of Babel" link="isa:46,1-13" lang="en" %}}.

This comparison shows that this shows the tension between Acts and Isaiah: God is sovereign over idols but Israel clings to them. This is especially a theme in {{% bible val="Acts 17" link="act:17" lang="en" %}}, where the Jews’ resistance is probably due to their clinging to idols.

Judgment is especially announced when these idols claim godliness (in the cases of {{% bible val="Simon" link="act:8,4-24" lang="en" %}}, {{% bible val="Herod" link="act:12,20-23" lang="en" %}} or {{% bible val="Elymas" link="act:13,10-11" lang="en" %}})

## Summary

<a name="f43c"></a>
The new Exodus for which Israel has been waiting for so long happens and is linked to Jesus. The question is whether Israel and the Gentiles will choose God (again) or remain with their idols, which is a serious problem.

The Gospel shows the tension between the restoration of Israel who believe in Christ and the salvation of the Gentiles who play together.
