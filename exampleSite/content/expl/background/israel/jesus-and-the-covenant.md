When Jesus came to earth, He “surprised” people with His message and His behavior, which was truly shocking to the Jews. Why and what does this have to do with the covenant?

## The expectation of the Day of the Lord

<a name="d8b5"></a>
At the time of Jesus, the Jews were awaiting the Day of the Lord, and there were a variety of interpretations of how this day might become a reality:

- (partial) withdrawal from society and increased observance of the law (Qumran),
- Increased observance of the law in society (Pharisees),
- Israel is rejected and God chooses the Romans (Jewish historian Josephus),
- Increased observance of the law and submission to and cooperation with the Roman leadership (Sadducees),
- Increased observance of the law and active resistance against the Romans (Zelotes)

## The challenge

<a name="298a"></a>
When the Bible talks about Jesus in the New Testament, it is very challenging. Let us look at the [beginning of the gospel of Mark](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/mark/1-1.htm). The gospel in Greek is evangeliou, which was usually used to announce the birth of a new emperor. This was already a political challenge to the emperor is Rome: The real king is Jesus.

But this goes on. Immediately after this, Mark refers to Isaiah, where the Day of the Lord is announced. Jesus did many things related to the history of Israel and its promises:

- The {{% bible val="calling of the 12 disciples" link="mrk:3,13-19" lang="en" %}} to a {{% bible val="mountain" link="luk:6,12-13" lang="en" %}} recalls the new creation of Israel (from 12 tribes) where the covenant was made on Mount Sinai.
- {{% bible val="The 40 days of temptation of Jesus in the desert" link="luk:4,1-13" lang="en" %}} are reminiscent of the temptations that Israel faced in the desert during the Exodus and failed (provision of water and bread, miracles, idolatry) and therefore had to wander in the desert for 40 years (after Israel believed the spies who wandered for 40 days) — interestingly 40 years after Jesus completed his mission in 30 AD the temple was destroyed.
- The healings of Jesus are a sign of the coming kingdom.
- The casting out of demons (which did not happen in the Old Testament) describes God’s restorative action against Israel’s enemies.
- The multiplication of bread recalls the manna in the desert.
- The calming of the storm recalls the Exodus.
- The meal with the sinners anticipates the final banquet of God with His people.

## The teachings of Jesus

<a name="b343"></a>
The teachings of Jesus were very confrontational toward Israel, for example, he picks up the {{% bible val="parable of the vineyard that bears no fruit" link="isa:5,1-7" lang="en" %}} from Isaiah which is a pruning of Israel. But Jesus {{% bible val="reuses this parable with the judgment to completely destroy Israel if they reject him" link="mat:21,33-45" lang="en" %}}.

The Day of the Lord will not be the restoration of Jerusalem and the temple as in Ezekiel 40 to 48, but {{% bible val="the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple" link="mrk:13" lang="en" %}}.

The coming of the Kingdom (Israel will reign with the Day of the Lord) will come in a hidden way

- {{% bible val="parable of the sower" link="mrk:4,1-20" lang="en" %}},
- {{% bible val="weeds in the field" link="mat:13,24-30" lang="en" %}} or the {{% bible val="parable of the fish net" link="mat:13,47-50" lang="en" %}},
- {{% bible val="growth of the seed" link="mrk:4,26-29" lang="en" %}},
- {{% bible val="parable of the mustard seed" link="mrk:4,30-32" lang="en" %}} (sees is 1mm, but tree two to three meters), {{% bible val="tree is a picture for God’s kingdom" link="ezk:17" lang="en" %}}, so the smallest becomes the biggest ({{% bible val="should be known to Israel" link="deu:7,7" lang="en" %}}),
- {{% bible val="yeast, which changes the whole dough" link="mat:13,33" lang="en" %}} (yeast was never used in the Old Testament as picture for the Kingdom of God) — a small amount turns unstoppably into a large amount in the hidden,
- {{% bible val="the hidden treasure and the pearl" link="mat:13,44-46" lang="en" %}} — the treasure must be sought, and when it is found, everything else must be given up.

The description of the beatitudes is also a challenge to Israel — because it challenges Israel to be true Israel, for all the promises are given to those who are faithful to Jesus:

- {{% bible val="The poor in spirit will receive the kingdom" link="mat:5,3" lang="en" %}}.
- {{% bible val="Those who mourn shall be comforted (with national rebirth)" link="mat:5,4" lang="en" %}}.
- {{% bible val="The meek shall inherit the land" link="mat:5,5" lang="en" %}}.
- {{% bible val="The pure in heart shall see God" link="mat:5,8" lang="en" %}}.
- {{% bible val="Peacemakers are those who are called children of God" link="mat:5,9" lang="en" %}} (title for Israel).

## A new thinking

<a name="a5cc"></a>
When Jesus came, people did not recognize His coming. They expected something else. After the Day of the Lord, he will

- come to destroy the enemies of Israel and
- to restore the remnant of Israel so that
- be rulers over the unbelieving nations.

There were some misconceptions

- Israel thought that the enemies were the oppressing nations.
- That the remnant were the religious people like the Pharisees.
- To rule means to rule over others as the other nations did.

First, Jesus presented a very different concept of rulership.

Second, Jesus was very clear that the enemies were not the Romans who were oppressing Israel at that time, but {{% bible val="the enemies were the demons" link="mrk:3,22-27" lang="en" %}} that He drove out on many occasions. {{% bible val="Driving them out is a sign that the Day of the Lord has come" link="mat:12,28" lang="en" %}}. This was especially {{% bible val="true at His death" link="jhn:12,31-33" lang="en" %}}.

Finally, the remnant are not the religious people, but those who keep the covenant of God, which {{% int_link val="is only Jesus Himself" link="/expl/bible/daniel/the-son-of-man-and-the-remnant" %}}. All others do not belong to the remnant and would be subject of the judgment, which is also Israel.

## Already but not yet

<a name="e3c4"></a>
{{% bible val="He says that the Day of the Lord has come (the Kingdom of God)" link="mrk:1,1-15" lang="en" %}}. The Gospel of Mark begins with the vision that introduces the second part of Isaiah which describes the restoration of Israel. {{% bible val="In his preaching" link="luk:4,16-21" lang="en" %}} He cites the fulfillment of the prophecy of {{% bible val="chapter 61 " link="luk:4,16-21" lang="en" %}}: “The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favour.”

But if you compare it with the {{% bible val="passage of Isaiah" link="isa:61,1-2" lang="en" %}} you will see that he stopped in the middle of the sentence: “to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor and the day of vengeance of our God”

Jesus did not come to judge because {{% bible val="He would have to judge everyone" link="mat:11,20-24" lang="en" %}} at this time, so He divided the Day of the Lord into two parts.
