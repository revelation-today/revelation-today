The book of Revelation in the Bible is full of strange time periods like 1260 days, 42 months, and so on. What do they mean? And do they have a literal meaning?

## A little math

<a name="e7f0"></a>
In the book of Revelation, chapters 11 through 13, there are four references to different times.

| Time | Reference |
|------|-----------|
| 42 months | {{% bible val="Outer area of the temple is left to the pagans" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation11%2C2" %}} |
| 1260 days | {{% bible val="witnesses with prophecy" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation11%2C3" %}} |
| 1260 days | {{% bible val="Woman is protected in the desert" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation12%2C6" %}} |
| 3,5 times | {{% bible val="Woman is protected in the desert" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation12%2C14" %}} |
| 42 months | {{% bible val="The first beast blasphems" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C5" %}} |

There are three different times called, the 3.5 times is called time, two times and half time. If we assume a month of 30 days, we get

1260 days = 42 months = 3.5 years =? 3.5 times

So do these times follow each other or do they all describe parallel activities?

Are the times symbolic or literal (exactly 1260 days)?

And why are they not in the same unit (months or days)?

Let’s first look at the Old Testament background.

## Elijah and the drought (1. Kings 16/29–18/35)

<a name="89d3"></a>
King Ahab of Israel marries Jezebel of Sidon (north of Israel). She introduces Baal and Ashera, the gods of fertility (many children, good harvests, strong armies — horses). But the key to this in most cases is: {{% bible val="Enough rain" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/1%20Kings17%3A8" %}}.

So God {{% bible val="sends Elijah to call for a drought" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/1%20Kings17%3A1" %}} that {{% bible val="lasted 3,5 years" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Luke4%3A25" %}}. He is supplied by ravens. Later, he{{% bible val=" went to a widow in Sidon with a dying son whom he saved, so that woman believed in God" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/1%20Kings17%3A6-24" %}}.

After he intervened in Jezebel’s country of origin, the {{% bible val="great power struggle on Mount Carmel over who is the true God" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/1%20Kings18%3A16-46" %}}. The true God is the one who can make {{% bible val="fire come down from heaven" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/1%20Kings18%3A24" %}}, which is also {{% bible val="something the second beast can also do" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A13" %}}.

The battle and the question here is, “Who is the true God?”.

## The year week in Daniel

<a name="96cb"></a>
In Daniel there are the [70 weeks which result in two half-weeks of 3.5 years each](/bible/daniel/expl/the-70-year-weeks). The first half-week describes the time of Jesus on earth and the second perhaps the work of the church. The covenant of Jesus is also {{% bible val="described as being in this week" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Daniel9%3A27" %}}.

These 3.5 years are what God is building up in the background that will overthrow the kingdoms of this world.

## What are the 3,5 years in Revelation

<a name="df73"></a>
Let’s go through and start with chapter 13. [This is the devil’s deception](/content/beasts/expl/the-nature-of-the-beast-in-the-book-of-revelation). When does it start? According to chapter 12, it happens after Jesus’ death on the cross, when he realizes that he cannot destroy Israel, which is protected by God, so pretty much after his death.

When does he stop? Never if he doesn’t have to, so until Jesus comes back.

At the same time the woman is {{% bible val="protected from the devil’s attack" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation12%3A6" %}} and {{% bible val="provided for in the desert" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation12%3A14" %}}. When does it begin? As soon as Jesus is victorious on the cross. When does it end? As long as the devil is around. So until Jesus returns.

Then we have {{% bible val="the temple" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation11%3A1-2" %}}. It is no longer used for sacrifices, but as a place of worship. When does it begin? With the death of Jesus. When will it end? I don’t think it will end until Jesus returns.

That leaves the {{% bible val="1260 days of the two witnesses" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation11%3A3" %}}. This must be the whole time between Jesus’ first and second coming. So they are not really two people, but most likely the Church.

So why are different units (days, months, …) used? The days are used when it comes to the reign of the witnesses and the provision of Israel, while the months are used for the reign of the devil and the destruction of the outskirts of the temple, and the 3.5 years/times are used for the hidden work of God. Perhaps the use is done to show the abundance of the 1260 days of the Church compared to the only 42 months of the devil. But this is a bit of a guess. I have no real idea.What does it mean?The rule of the devil and the absolute rule of the Church are parallel. Even though the world seems to be ruled by the devil, the Church is still in charge.
