In the beginning everything was good. God created everything perfectly and put Adam as Govenor over it - in the Garden Eden.

Really everything? Well, one thing was not good and this, was that man was alone. So God created him a counterpart: Eve. Things then were very good.

However Adam started to love the things God had given him, more than God himself and therefore the relationship with God broke apart.

Adam and his descendents were banished out of the Garden and so they decided to build and settle in towns. However, God longed for the fellowship with man, so he chose another person to be with him: Abraham. Abraham chose once again to live in relationship with God and chose God over the gift of Isaac, his long awaited son.
