At the beginning everything was good. God created everthing perfectly and put Adam as governeur over it - in the Garden Eden.

Really everything? One thing was not good and this was that the man was alone. So god created him a counterpart: Eve. 

But this soon became a problem because Adam loves Eve more than God and obeyed her word and the relationship with God broke apart.

Adam and his descendents settled in town. But God longed for the fellowship with man so he chose on person: Abraham to be with him and now God lived with man.
