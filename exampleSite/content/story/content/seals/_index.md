Chapter 5 opens with a bang. As up to this point all seems to be understandable we are entering now the chapter with rather unusual pictures.

First we see a scroll with seven seals that nobody is able to open and we wonder what is written inside. But this is not the question but who is worthy to bring this into action: Fulfill Gods plan. 

There is only one: Jesus. But he shows up in a paradox way. He is announced as strong hero but shows up a a weak slaughtered lamb. This is the key of the book. Our strenght is not brute force but of other nature.

When Jesus opens the scroll another one shows up (or should I better say is exposed). The devil will all his promises and power is shown in the picture of the four horsemen as total disappointment.

Finally Jesus comes and brings all to an end.
