So it’s on you and me and all the church to get up and be ready for the big adventure by looking up.

The solution for all of this is in heaven: The throne room of God where we all have access at any time. It is the place of worship where we find our place in relation to God.

But when you think, sitting and worship will solve all the problems, you are wrong, because worship is so much more: It is full loyalty to God in all aspects of our live. And here we meet Jesus the crucified.

He is our real hero and guide in this huge journey as he is worthy to rule the world. But when we accept and live this we start a journey there is no turning back.
