This sounds strange. Isn’t the Church greater than Israel? Or is the Church replacing Israel? Or will Israel make a comeback at the end of times without the church? This implies a controversy that does not exist.

## The mystery of the Gentiles

<a name="a99c"></a>
In the letter to the Ephesians Paul writes: “{{% bible val="that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly. In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets. This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus." link="eph:3,3-6" lang="NIV" %}}”

The mystery is not a secret but an unbelievable act: The Gentiles share with Israel the heritage, the same body and the promises. They are united by Christ, which is a {{% bible val="fulfillment of Isaiah" link="isa:57,19" lang="NIV" %}}.

Jesus is the New Covenant, and Jews and Gentiles are end-time Israel. This began when Jesus died on the cross and will be completed when He returns. The end-time Israel is not a nation, but is defined by belonging to Jesus.

There are many terms used in the Old Testament for Israel that are now used for the Church, which is the new Israel, which includes ethnic Israel that believes in Jesus, which includes Gentiles that believe in Jesus. In fact, {{% bible val="the covenant with Israel was only an intermediary between Abraham and the Church" link="gal:3,23-28" lang="NIV" %}}.

## Beloved of the Lord

<a name="3d64"></a>
This is a term used when God calls the {{% bible val="tribe of Benjamin" link="deu:33,12" lang="NIV" %}}, when He speaks about of {{% bible val="Israel breaking the covenant" link="jer:11,15" lang="NIV" %}}.

But we also find this term when {{% bible val="Paul mentions that the we are chosen" link="1th:1,4" lang="NIV" %}}. Interestingly he also uses the term “ekklesia” here, which is used in the Old Testament to describe when Israel gathers together to worship God.

In the {{% bible val="letter of the Romans" link="rom:9,25" lang="NIV" %}} the prophet {{% bible val="Hosea is called to calls Israel his beloved" link="hos:2,23" lang="NIV" %}} which is now fulfilled for the Gentiles.

## Gods son

<a name="639c"></a>
Israel is called God’s son,

- even the {{% bible val="first-born son when God calls for the Exodus" link="exo:4,22-23" lang="NIV" %}},
- {{% bible val="in the introduction on how to treat yourself" link="deu:14,1" lang="NIV" %}},
- {{% bible val="when Israel had forgotten that God was their father" link="isa:1,2-4" lang="NIV" %}},
- {{% bible val="a confirmation of how God cares for His children" link="isa:63,8" lang="NIV" %}},
- {{% bible val="Israel is called in the future when they grow up as God’s children" link="hos:1,10" lang="NIV" %}},
- {{% bible val="when God remembers the Exodus" link="hos:11,1" lang="NIV" %}},
- {{% bible val="when Israel’s tribe Ephraim is called first-born" link="jer:31,9" lang="NIV" %}},
- {{% bible val="spoken of as first-born of David’s son" link="psa:89,27" lang="NIV" %}}.

The church is called God’s Son, just as Jesus is God’s Son and we are {{% bible val="all His brothers" link="heb:2,11" lang="NIV" %}} because {{% bible val="we are all adopted by Him" link="gal:4,4-7" lang="NIV" %}}. As {{% bible val="Jesus is Abraham’s seed" link="gal:3,16" lang="NIV" %}}, {{% bible val="so are we" link="gal:3,26-29" lang="NIV" %}}. We are {{% bible val="children of the promise like Isaac" link="gal:4,28" lang="NIV" %}} and {{% bible val="Jerusalem is our mother" link="gal:4,26" lang="NIV" %}}.

{{% bible val="We are also called the descendants of Israel" link="1co:10,1" lang="NIV" %}}.

## Circumcision

<a name="7f94"></a>
This is actually something {{% bible val="that goes back to Abraham" link="jhn:7,22" lang="NIV" %}}. Paul states {{% bible val="that a Jew who is only circumcised “outwardly” but not in his heart is not a Jew" link="rom:2,26-29" lang="NIV" %}}, {{% bible val="later confirming" link="php:3,2-3" lang="NIV" %}} and showing that {{% bible val="true circumcision is only possible in Christ" link="php:3,2-3" lang="NIV" %}}.

## The temple

<a name="3b81"></a>
Another identification is the temple which is the place where Israel had fellowship with God. We are now {{% bible val="that temple now" link="1co:3,16-17" lang="NIV" %}} and should therefore {{% bible val="take care on our lifestyle" link="1co:6,19" lang="NIV" %}}. The {{% bible val="temple is based on Jesus" link="eph:2,20-22" lang="NIV" %}}.

## Bride of God

<a name="9c2e"></a>
Israel is called the {{% bible val="bride of God" link="isa:54,5-6" lang="NIV" %}} in the Old Testament, even {{% bible val="in times of unfaithfulness," link="ezk:16,32" lang="NIV" %}} which God even had {{% bible val="Hosea illustrate by marrying a woman" link="hos:1,2" lang="NIV" %}}.

But the {{% bible val="church is also called a bride" link="2co:11,2" lang="NIV" %}}, and the {{% bible val="marriage to Christ is compared to the marriage between a man and a woman" link="eph:5,25-27" lang="NIV" %}}.

In Revelation the {{% bible val="bride of Christ is the church" link="rev:21,9-10" lang="NIV" %}} which includes elements of the church ({{% bible val="apostles" link="rev:21,14" lang="NIV" %}}) as well as Israel ({{% bible val="tribes" link="rev:21,12" lang="NIV" %}})

## Kingdom of priests

<a name="324b"></a>
Israel is called a {{% bible val="kingdom of priests" link="exo:19,6" lang="NIV" %}} which is directly applied to the church in {{% bible val="Peter" link="1pe:2,9" lang="NIV" %}}, the introduction in {{% bible val="Revelation" link="rev:1,5-6" lang="NIV" %}} and later in the {{% bible val="worship of Christ" link="rev:5,10" lang="NIV" %}}.

## Gods vineyard

<a name="3501"></a>
God applies the image of the {{% bible val="vineyard to Israel" link="isa:5,1-7" lang="NIV" %}}, which is {{% bible val="mistreated" link="jer:12,10" lang="NIV" %}} or {{% bible val="abundant" link="ezk:19,10" lang="NIV" %}}. Jesus picks up {{% bible val="this image and shows the failure of Israel and gives it to others who bring fruit" link="mat:12,1-12" lang="NIV" %}}, which is then applied by {{% bible val="Paul to the church" link="1co:3,5-8" lang="NIV" %}}.

## Olive tree

<a name="e179"></a>
Israel is mentioned as an olive tree, e.g. for the {{% bible val="northern kingdom" link="isa:17,6" lang="NIV" %}}, to remind them when {{% bible val="they broke the covenant" link="jer:11,16" lang="NIV" %}} or when he {{% bible val="calls Israel for restoration" link="hos:14,6" lang="NIV" %}}.

This could be {{% bible val="individuals in Israel" link="psa:128,3" lang="NIV" %}} or leaders such as a {{% bible val="judge in Israel" link="jdg:9,8-9" lang="NIV" %}} or {{% bible val="King David" link="psa:52,8" lang="NIV" %}} or {{% bible val="Joshua and Zerubbabel" link="zec:4,3-12" lang="NIV" %}}.

On the other hand the {{% bible val="Gentiles are described as becoming part of the olive tree" link="rom:11,17-24" lang="NIV" %}} and the {{% bible val="church is identified" link="rev:1,20" lang="NIV" %}} as the {{% bible val="two olive trees from the prophet Zechariah" link="zec:4,12-14" lang="NIV" %}} which is further elaborated in the {{% bible val="context of the two witnesses" link="rev:11,4" lang="NIV" %}}.

## Treasured possession of God

<a name="123e"></a>
Let’s have a look at Titus: “{{% bible val="Who gave Himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for Himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good." link="tit:2,14" lang="NIV" %}}”

God calls His Israel as His {{% bible val="very own treasured possession" link="exo:19,5" lang="NIV" %}}, because he {{% bible val="chose Israel" link="deu:7,6" lang="NIV" %}} to the {{% bible val="pure" link="deu:14,2" lang="NIV" %}} so that {{% bible val="Israel should follow His commandments" link="deu:26,18" lang="NIV" %}}.

The phrase “eager to do what is good” is a call for Israel to be obedient to God.

Redeem from all wickedness is a reference to the {{% bible val="Psalms where Israel is promised to be redeemed from all wickedness" link="psa:130,8" lang="NIV" %}}.

## The ministry

<a name="121f"></a>

{{% bible val="Isaiah 49" link="ezk:9,39" lang="NIV" %}} is fulfilled in the church.

| Isaiah 49 | Jesus | is fulfilled in the church |
|-----------|-------|----------------------------|
| And he said unto me, Thou art my servant, thou art Israel, by <span style="color:red;">whom I glorify.</span> ({{% bible val="Isa.49/3" link="isa:49,3" lang="NIV" %}} </br> And now the LORD, who formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob back to him-Israel not gathered, yet I was honored in the eyes of the LORD, and my God was my strength-yes, he says, "It <span style="color:red;">is small</span> that thou art my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to bring again the preserved out of <span style="color:brown;">Israel</span>; but I have set thee also for <span style="color:green;">light</span> unto the <span style="color:brown;">Gentiles</span>, that <span style="color:black;">thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth</span>!" {{% bible val="(Isa.49/5-6)" link="isa:49,5-6" lang="NIV" %}} </br>and I will keep thee, and set thee for a covenant for the people, for a <span style="color:green;">light</span> for the Gentiles; that thou mayest not see the <span style="color:green;">open the eyes of the blind</span>, bring out the <span style="color:red;">bound from prison</span> and from the dungeon those who sit in <span style="color:green;">darkness</span>. {{% bible val="Isa.42/6-7" link="isa:42,6-7" lang="NIV" %}} </br> I will lead the blind by a way they know not, and guide them in paths unknown to them; I will make the <span style="color:green;">darkness light</span> before them, and the hilly a plain. These words I will fulfill and will not let go of them. {{% bible val="Isa.42/16" link="isa:42,16" lang="NIV" %}} | a <span style="color:green;">light</span> for revelation to the <span style="color:brown;">pagans</span> and for <span style="color:red;">glorification</span> of your people <span style="color:brown;">Israel</span>! {{% bible val="Lk.2/32" link="luk:2,32" lang="NIV" %}} </br> namely, that the Christ must suffer, and that, as the firstfruits from the resurrection of the dead, he would preach <span style="color:green;">light</span> <span style="color:brown;">to the people</span> and also to the <span style="color:brown;">Gentiles</span>. {{% bible val="Acts 26/23" link="act:26,23" lang="NIV" %}} | For thus the Lord has commanded us, "I have set you as <span style="color:green;">light</span> to the <span style="color:brown;">Gentiles</span>, that you may be <span style="color:brown;">salvation to the ends of the earth</span>!" {{% bible val="Rev.17/3" link="rev:17,3" lang="NIV" %}} </br> To open their <span style="color:green;">eyes</span>, that they may be converted from <span style="color:green;">darkness to light</span> and from the <span style="color:red;">dominion of Satan to God</span>, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me! {{% bible val="Acts 26/18" link="act:26,18" lang="NIV" %}} |

## Pouring out of the Spirit

<a name="a1c3"></a>
You may know that the {{% bible val="prophecy of Joel" link="jol:2,28-32" lang="NIV" %}} of the outpouring of the Spirit is {{% bible val="fulfilled at Pentecost" link="act:2,16-21" lang="NIV" %}}.

But if you look at the context, there is an important point. This describes the restoration of Israel from {{% bible val="verse 18" link="jol:2,18" lang="NIV" %}} on, especially the {{% bible val="verse after that refers to Israel" link="jol:3,1" lang="NIV" %}}. Also the outpouring of the Spirit was promised only to {{% bible val="Israel" link="ezk:36,27" lang="NIV" %}} and the {{% bible val="servant" link="isa:42,1" lang="NIV" %}}, never to the nations.

The outpouring of the Spirit was to take place {{% bible val="in the last days" link="act:2,17" lang="NIV" %}}, a phrase used in that way only in {{% bible val="Isaiah" link="isa:2,2" lang="NIV" %}}, where it describes when the nations come to Jerusalem. These {{% bible val="nations are listed" link="act:2,5-11" lang="NIV" %}} and are a {{% bible val="smaller version of the scattered list from the Tower of Babel" link="gen:10" lang="NIV" %}}, showing that this applies to all nations.

When {{% bible val="Cornelius and his household received the Holy Spirit" link="act:10,44-48" lang="NIV" %}}, it was so {{% bible val="astonishing that there were no objection anymore to Peter to enter a Gentile house" link="act:11,1-18" lang="NIV" %}}.

Acts 2 is fulfillment of Acts 1 (filled with the Holy Spirit. Acts 1/8 is fulfillment of Isaiah.

| Isaiah | Acts 1:8 |
|--------|----------|
| until the <span style="color:red;">Spirit from on high is poured out upon us</span>. Then the desert will become a garden of fruit, and the garden of fruit will be esteemed as a forest. {{% bible val="Isa.32/15" link="isa:32,15" lang="NIV" %}} </br> <span style="color:green;">You are my witnesses</span>, says the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen, that you may know and believe me and see that I am he; before me there was no God formed, and after me there will be none {{% bible val="Isa.43/10" link="isa:43,10" lang="NIV" %}}. </br> <span style="color:green;">And ye are my witnesses</span>, saith the LORD, that I am God {{% bible val="Isa.43/12" link="isa:43,12" lang="NIV" %}}. </br> But I have also set you to be light to the Gentiles, that <span style="color:brown;">you may be my salvation to the ends of the earth</span>! {{% bible val="Isa.49/6" link="isa:49,6" lang="NIV" %}} | but you will receive power (fulfillment of {{% bible val="Luke" link="luk:24,49" lang="NIV" %}}) when the <span style="color:red;">Holy Spirit has come upon you</span>, and you will be <span style="color:green;">my witnesses</span> in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and <span style="color:brown;">to the ends of the earth</span>! (See {{% bible val="History of the Apostles" link="act:13,47" lang="NIV" %}}, which refers to {{% bible val="Isaiah" link="isa:49,6" lang="NIV" %}}). |
