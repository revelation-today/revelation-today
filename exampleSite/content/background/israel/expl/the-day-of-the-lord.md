When you hear “Day of the Lord”, you think of the destruction of the world. But that is not the case. If you want to know more and see where this comes from, stay with me.

## Origin of the Day of the Lord

<a name="674e"></a>
Israel had a [covenant with God](/background/israel/expl/gods-covenant). The purpose of the {{% bible val="covenant was to be a blessing to all nations" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Genesis12%3A2-3" %}} because it {{% bible val="was based on the covenant with Abraham" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Exodus3%3A6" %}}.

When Israel came out of Egypt, they {{% bible val="took with them many other people who became part of Israel" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Exodus12%3A38" %}}.

Keeping the covenant meant blessings

- {{% bible val="have fertile land and abundance" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Leviticus26%3A3-5" %}},
- {{% bible val="has peace and victory over enemies" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Leviticus26%3A6-8" %}},
- {{% bible val="God lives with His people" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Leviticus26%3A11-12" %}},
- {{% bible val="will no longer be slaves" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Leviticus26%3A13" %}}.

But when they failed, they experienced the course that resulted in exile, which after {{% bible val="many ups and downs" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Judges2%3A6-22" %}} ended in the {{% bible val="exile" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/2%20Chronicles36%3A15-23" %}} and {{% bible val="God leaving Israel" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Ezekiel11%3A22-24" %}}.

But God promised {{% bible val="to have mercy on them" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Leviticus26%3A40-46" %}}.

Many prophets spoke about this: During the exile these were

- Isaiah (chapter 40–55)
- Ezekiel
- Daniel
- Obadiah

When Israel finally came out of exile, things looked good:

- The temple was rebuild under Ezra.
- The wall was build under Nehemiah.
- {{% bible val="Joshua was set up as the high priest" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Zechariah3" %}} and {{% bible val="Zerubbabel as the ruler" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Zechariah4" %}} who would establish the kingdom of God.

They

- {{% bible val="were still in slavery" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Ezra9" %}},
- did not own the land (under Persian rule),
- {{% bible val="blessing of the Lord did not come" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Haggai1%3A7-12" %}}, the {{% bible val="land was still under the course" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Malachi3%3A10-11" %}},
- {{% bible val="the outpouring out of the Spirit did not occur" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Ezekiel36%3A25-27" %}}.

So Israel is still in the exile and it will end with the Day of the Lord.

This are the things prophesied in

- Haggai
- Zechariah
- Isaiah 56–66
- Malachi

The Day of the Lord will bring

- {{% bible val="judgment on the enemies of Israel" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Joel2%3A1-11" %}},
- {{% bible val="restoration of Israel" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Joel2%3A12-27" %}},
- {{% bible val="judgment on the wicked in Israel" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Zephaniah1%3A4-9" %}},
- God fulfills His promises like the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.

But this will happen only to the [remnant of Israel](/background/israel/expl/the-remnant-of-israel).
