title: "The second Exodus"
---


There was an exodus from Egypt. But when Israel failed to keep the law, they went into exile. Filled with promises of their return, when they returned from exile, they saw that nothing had changed. So the conclusion: They are still in exile, waiting for a new exodus. And that is coming with Jesus!


## The exodus in Mark

<a name="70f4"></a>
The beginning of the gospel of Mark has many references to the Exodus:

- [I will send my messenger](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Mark1%3A2) is a parallel to the [leading angel in the Exodus](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Exodus23%3A20) and also the [messenger for the Day of the Lord](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Malachi3%3A1), which are a warning and judgment in case of disobedience.
- [A voice of one calling in the wilderness, “Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.”](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Mark1%3A3) refers to the prophecy of [Isaiah](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah40%3A3), which is a message of restoration.
- [“And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Mark1%3A4)” is the [fulfillment of Elijah, preparing the new Exodus before the coming of the Day of the Lord](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Malachi4%3A5).
- [“Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Mark1%3A10)” refers to [Isaiah](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah63%3A11-19).
- [“And a voice came from heaven: ‘You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.’](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Mark1%3A11)” refers to the faithful servant of the Lord in Isaiah.
- [“After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. ‘The time has come,’ he said. ‘The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!’](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Mark1%3A14-15)” is the final [announcement of a new king](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah52%3A7).

<p>The structure in the Gospel of Mark reflects the structure of Isaiah</p>.

## The new Exodus in Luke

<a name="1f7d"></a>
The key to the Gospel of Luke is “[As it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah: ‘A voice of one calling in the wilderness, “Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him. Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth. And all people will see God’s salvation.” ’](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Luke3%3A4-6)”

This is the [same reference as the beginning of Mark](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah40%3A2-3).

The way is the Exodus and is God’s way of restoring Israel through the church.

When [Jesus read from Isaiah, he stated its fulfillment](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Luke4%3A16-30), whic[h was the sign of the second Exodus](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah61%3A1-2).

The Gospel of [Luke ends with the fulfillment of the Scripture](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Luke24%3A44-49) that [refers to the restoration of Israel and the inclusion of the Gentiles in Isaiah](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah49%3A6).


## The new Exodus in Acts

<a name="a809"></a>
Luke uses the way 6 times in the book of Acts

- [during the conversion of Saul](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts9%3A2),
- [in Ephesus](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts19%3A9) even [twice](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts19%3A23),
- [in Paul’s speech](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts22%3A4) to the crowd in Jerusalem,
- [to his speech to Felix](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts24%3A14) also [twice](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts24%3A22).


In the book of Acts you will also find 6 main messages of the Exodus

- Restoration of the tribes of Israel by the 12 apostles,
- [Pentecost included Jews from all nations](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts2%3A5), referring to the restoration of the Jews in exile,
- The [coming of the Holy Spirit](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts2),
- [Restoration of Kingdom of David](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts15%3A13-18),
- [Inclusion of expelled to the people of God](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts8%3A28-38),
- Israel’s initial repentance at [Pentecost](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts2%3A41-47), in the [early church](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts5%3A14), [in the election of Steven](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts6%3A1-7), in the [church at Antioch](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts11%3A24) and finally in chapter 12 — the [book ends with](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts28%3A26-27) where [Isaiah begins](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah6%3A9-10), with Israel’s rejection of the message of Jesus.


A key theme is the Word of God in the book of Acts, which spreads after the [election of Steven](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts6:7), [after the death of Herod](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts12:24) and during [Paul’s time in Ephesus](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts19%3A20), echoing important positions in Isaiah: [How can God be compared](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah40%3A18-24), he [is more reliable than idols](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah41%3A4-10), the [vanity of idols](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah44%3A9-20) and [the idols of Babel](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah46%3A1-13).

This comparison shows that this shows the tension between Acts and Isaiah: God is sovereign over idols but Israel clings to them. This is especially a theme in [Acts 17](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts17), where the Jews’ resistance is probably due to their clinging to idols.

Judgment is especially announced when these idols claim godliness (in the cases of [Simon](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts8%3A4-24), [Herod](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts12%3A20-23) or [Elymas](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Acts13%3A10-11))


## Summary

<a name="f43c"></a>
The new Exodus for which Israel has been waiting for so long happens and is linked to Jesus. The question is whether Israel and the Gentiles will choose God (again) or remain with their idols, which is a serious problem.

The Gospel shows the tension between the restoration of Israel who believe in Christ and the salvation of the Gentiles who play together.
