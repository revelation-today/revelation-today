title: "Who is Israel"

What do you think is Israel? Are these all the descendants of Abraham? Surely not, it is far more complicated or easier! And what is Israel in the New Testament? What’s about Jews that don’t believe in God?


## The origin and purpose of Israel

<a name="1bcd"></a>
After the fall of man, humankind drifted more and more away from God. The flood did not change anything and finally the people [decided to make a name for themselves and wanted to build a tower in Babel that reaches the heaven](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Genesis11%3A1-10). But God stopped this and [made a name out of Abraham](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Genesis12%3A1-2) (at this time still called Abram). He made a [covenant](../../../../background/israel/expl/gods-covenant) with him and [wanted that his descendant are a blessing to the whole world](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Genesis12%3A3).

Abraham become a big family and they moved over to Egypt due to a famine. After a long time there, they became a big people and were enslaved. God showed with the [10 plagues](../../../../bible/exodus/expl/the-plagues-in-egypt) that he takes are for his better, far better than the Egyptian Gods or their kingdom can.

In the story of the Pessah (just before the last plague) God gives rules that show his intention with Israel. [Everybody who wants to live permanently there and be part of the covenant becomes Israel](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Exodus12%3A48-49) — because covenant means to become part of a family. God wanted that Israel will include all nations so that all are brought back in relationship with God. And this happened, [a lot of others joined Israel when they leave Egypt](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Exodus12%3A38).

And God made a new covenant with these people at Sinai as a covenant which became the constitution for the new nation “Israel”.

More people joined like [Rahab](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Joshua2), [Ruth vs. Orpah](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Ruth1), [Uriah](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/2%20Samuel11%3A3) and many others. [But this did not reach so far](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Matthew23%3A15).


## Israel fails the covenant

<a name="7249"></a>
But there was a more severe problem. Israel became worse than their neighbors and they failed the covenant. The consequence was that they needed to go into exile. But God spoke through the prophets that after the exile he will restore the remnant of Israel and is will reach its full purpose. So when the exile ended after 70 years, Israel expected all this fulfilled.

But this did not happen. The conclusion was that Israel was still in the exile they are waiting for another exodus like out of Egypt which was called the [“Day of the Lord”, when all these promises are fulfilled](../../../../background/israel/expl/the-day-of-the-lord). These promises were [for the remnant of Israel and included that the nations will be part of Israel](../../../../background/israel/expl/the-remnant-of-israel).


## A new beginning

<a name="a1e0"></a>
When Jesus came the first time he claimed in [his words and actions that the Day of the Lord has come](../../../../background/israel/expl/jesus-and-the-covenant), and the gospels are written reflecting the “[Second Exodus](../../../../background/israel/expl/the-second-exodus)”.

With this he also redefined Israel. He called himself “[Son of Man](../../../../bible/daniel/expl/the-son-of-man-and-the-remnant)” and made himself the remnant of Israel and he started a [new covenant starting with Israel that was willing](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Matthew15%3A24) to join including all the Gentiles.

But the [Day of the Lord has only partially arrived, so we are living in a time in between](../../../../background/israel/expl/jesus-and-the-covenant#e3c4), where the kingdom of God is there, but not fully yet.

[The Gentiles are now a part of Israel and there is no distinction how Israel was treated in the Old Testament and how the church with Israel together in the New Testament.](../../../../background/israel/expl/the-church-is-part-of-israel)

[The church did not replace Israel but Israel fulfilled its mission reaching the Gentiles in the church](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Romans9).
