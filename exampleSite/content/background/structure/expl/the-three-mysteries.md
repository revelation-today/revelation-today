The book of Revelation speaks of three mysteries: the mystery of the Church, the mystery of God, and the mystery of the beast. What are these mysteries, and what is a mystery? You will see this soon and also how this gives a new perspective on the structure of the book.

## The mystery

<a name="e458"></a>
The [word mystery](https://www.bibleserver.com/search/NIV/mystery) appears only once in the Old Testament prophets: In the book of Daniel, where the [destruction of the world’s powers is described by something set up by God](../../../../bible/daniel/expl/the-four-kingdoms-in-daniel) that looks very small and weak. It is not a secret, but something that is unbelievable.

Also in the New Testament, this term speaks of God’s plan, that [is now revealed](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Colossians1%3A26): It is Christ on the cross, not in defeat but conquest of the world.

This mystery is described in detail in the book of Daniel. This book shows how God is restoring the world and destroying evil with the church as a key partner in there (see [the little book in chapter 11](../../../../content/scroll/expl/the-little-scroll)). But when we look at the Church as God’s army, we may be surprised by the means of battle:

- Their key strength and qualification seems to be [their faithfulness to God](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation14%3A4) (virgins).
- Their keys to success are worship, testimony, perseverance, and prayer, which will bring down the evil rulers.
- They seem to have a [different view of conquering and being victorious](../../../../topics/hero/short/a-real-hero).

## The mystery of the church

<a name="f192"></a>
The [mystery of the church](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation1%3A20) is to be [light to the world in dependence on Jesus](../../../../content/letters/expl/the-angel-of-the-churches). This is worked out in chapters 1–9.

These are the criteria by which the churches are measured in the [letters](../../../../content/letters/expl/the-letters-to-the-seven-churches). And the answer to grow in strength is in the next chapter, [which describes worship](../../../../content/worship/expl/worship-in-the-throne-room).

The church needs to look at Jesus, who was obedient ([worship is the expression of loyalty even to death](../../../../topics/power/short/worship)) and now exposes the devil’s deception that [leads to the suffering of the church](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation6%3A9-11). Before [Jesus ends all this and reveals Himself](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation6%3A12-17), the church must understand that [it is His army](../../../../content/army/expl/the-144000) which [also finds rest in Him](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation7%3A9-17).

Now the Church [can go out in prayer and shake the earth](../../../../content/trumpets/expl/the-trumpets-in-revelation). But prayer alone is not enough! It needs more: The revelation of God. This is revealed through worship as the essence of the relationship with God.

## The mystery of God

<a name="b548"></a>
The [mystery of God](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation10%3A7) can be seen in many ways in chapter 10:

- [He rules sovereignly over all the earth](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation10%3A2).
- God has the bigger job (big scroll from chapter 5) the church does not carry it all (little scroll).

It starts with the temple: The place of God’s presence is for worship.

The [Church will not be effective if it doesn’t imitate Jesus](../../../../content/witnesses/expl/the-two-witnesses).

This is shown in the life of [Jesus how He was victorious](../../../../content/jesus/expl/a-different-christmas-story). The Church should not be [worried by the deception of the beasts and learn from it](../../../../content/beasts/expl/the-nature-of-the-beast-in-the-book-of-revelation).

[God will be with His people](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation14%3A1-5) and [give everyone the rewards of their lives](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation14%3A6-20).

[Now God is going into action and fighting for the hearts of the peoples and bringing down the kingdom of the devil](../../../../content/bowls/expl/the-bowls-of-wrath), which brings us to the last topic.

## The mystery of the Harlot

<a name="3f20"></a>
The [last mystery](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A5) describes the church in the perfect state as the total opposite of the devil. There are several important points here:

- The secret of the harlot is never revealed — always be on your watch that you are not part of it.
- [The harlot has set up a great network to protect her, which will destroy her in the end ](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17).
- The great chapter on the harlot is countered by the long story of the New Jerusalem (the Bride, the Church), which is the opposite. The church should be careful not to get entangled with the harlot, or it will go down with her.
