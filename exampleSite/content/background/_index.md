As a good foundation for our work we need to get a better understanding of the following topics:
- What was the historical situation of the first readers? 
    - Which topics might be addressed?
    - How would they read it?
- What type of literature are we reading?
    - Do we need to take everything literally?
    - Or rather symbolic?
    - How does it help us to understand the emphasis of the writer?
- What is the structure of the book?
    - When does a new section start?
    - What is the key statement of a section?
- As a topper:
    - We need a better understanding of the role of Israel
