title: "The Day of the Lord"

The Day of the Lord is often understood as a day of vengeance and disaster. This was what the Jews expected, and Jesus turned that around.

## The story before

<a name="3fd1"></a>
The book of Revelation has a story that goes back to creation. God created man and woman to represent Him in the creation He had made. They were to be his counterparts and he wanted a relationship with them.

But they failed and chose to reject Him (Fall of Man). This broke all kinds of relationships.

- to themselves (shame)
- to each other (blame and fight, see later murder of Abel)
- to God (had to leave Eden)
- to the Creation (Creation created trouble to feed them)

But things get even worse, so God had His plan to call a person and teach people how to live in relationship with Him again: Abraham, with whom he made a covenant. From him descended the nations of Israel, and he made a covenant with them. These events are linked to the Exodus from Egypt.

But Israel did not fulfill its covenant and was a terrible example to teach the world how to live in a covenant with God. So they went into exile (the final judgment for leaving the covenant). But God did not give up. He made promises for the time after the exile, which are written in many of the prophets such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel or Daniel.

This includes

- Israel is restored
- Israel’s enemies are destroyed
- The nations become part of Israel
- The Holy Spirit is poured out on all Israel.
- God’s people will live with Him forever, all evil is gone.

The prophets called this event the “Day of the Lord. But when the exile ended after 70 years and Israel returned from the exile, nothing changed. How could this happen?

The answer was: Israel was still in exile and needed another Exodus like the one out of Egypt, and that is yet to come.

## The big surprise

The Day of the Lord was the great expectation of the Jews, when the Messiah would come and set everything right. But the Day of the Lord came in a very different way than expected, even though it was not supposed to be a surprise:

- This day was to mark the completion of Israel’s mission to save the Gentiles.
- This day will be fulfilled by the Son of Man or the Servant of God.
- The salvation of the Gentiles is a central part of it.
- The enemies of Israel/God were not really people, but sin/demons.

## Jesus

<a name="f315"></a>
When Jesus came, He brought the Day of the Lord.

He called himself “Son of Man” and thus the last remnant of Israel. Israel had failed in its mission to save the nations and needed to be saved itself. So Jesus came to save Israel, but also to reestablish it:

- He called 12 disciples according to the 12 tribes of Israel
- He fasted 40 days (imitating key events in the Exodus: {{% bible val="Receiving the Commandments" link="exo:34,28" lang="NIV" %}}, {{% bible val="Inspection of the Promised Land by the spies" link="num:14,34" lang="NIV" %}}).
- After the 40 days, He overcame all the temptations that Israel failed to overcome in the desert.

In doing so, He saved not only Israel, but also the nations who will not be a part of Israel. This created another situation — the Day of the Lord was divided into two:

- At Jesus’ first coming, He is there for the salvation of the nation and the restoration of Israel, which takes some time because at His first coming, all would fall under judgment.
- But at Jesus’ second coming, He will come and execute the judgment.

## The Church

What is the role of the Church? The church is the new Israel (beginning with the believers from Israel), enlarged by the nations who have accepted Jesus. The Church is to reach all nations as Israel was to be (or rather, Abraham through whom all nations were to be blessed).

But there is an important detail: When Jesus talked about the coming Church, He said that the Church would be {{% bible val="persecuted" link="jhn:15,20" lang="NIV" %}}, something that Israel did not experience (judgment came only when they disobeyed).

When Jesus returns, the intent is for all nations to be saved and all to have a relationship with God-the original purpose-and of course the persecution will end.
