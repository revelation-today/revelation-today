In times of Corona or wars or climate change or personal crisis you ask yourself, how can I deal with this. 

The Book of Revelation adresses this in the scope of the trumpets. 

It starts with the {{% bible val="sealing of the saints" link="rev:7,1-4" lang="en" %}} which gives a protection against the {{% bible val="fifth trumpet" link="rev:9,4" lang="en" %}} which {{% bible val="causes people loosing the will to live" link="rev:9,6" lang="en" %}}.

Let's break this down and see how we can apply this:
- Who are the saints? These are the {{% int_link val="heros" link="/appl/topics/today/hero" %}} in our story. What would it take you to become such a hero?
- Why are they sealed? All who {{% int_link val="are not being deceived by wrong promises" link="/quick/content/seals/" %}} and {{% int_link val="hold firm to God" link="/quick/content/army/" %}}. Take some time to reflect {{% int_link val="on wrong promises" link="/appl/content/seals/ %}} and {{% int_link val="your strenght" link="/appl/content/army/ %}}.
- What are the trumpets about? They are {{% int_link val="taking all securities away" link="/quick/content/trumpets/" %}} so that we {{% bible val="see what actually remains unaffected" link="heb:12,27-28" lang="en" %}}. Take some {{% int_link val="time to reflect" link="/appl/content/trumpets/" %}}.
