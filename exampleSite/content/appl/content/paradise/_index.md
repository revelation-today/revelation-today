The book of Revelation ends on a high note with heaven. But if we take a closer look, there is a lot that is easily overlooked in the reading. Let’s take a look together.

## Our text

<a name="6a6c"></a>
We are moving quickly forward and {{% bible val="chapter 21" link="rev:21" lang="en" %}} and {{% bible val="22" link="rev:22" lang="en" %}}.

## The key point of heaven

<a name="2929"></a>
When we look at the description of the New Heaven, we probably think of the end of suffering and sorrow, or the luxurious environment in the New Heaven. But that is not really the point.

But I would like to draw attention to some other important aspects:

- The New Jerusalem is coming down: This will be a reality on {{% bible val="earth" link="rev:22" lang="en" %}}, not an abstract existence, but a new body as we pray in the Pater Noster (“as in heaven so on earth” becomes a reality).
- The Tree of Life: At the end of the description of heaven, people have access to the Tree of Life, which means that the separation between God and man is dissolved and the relationship is restored.
- The Temple: This passage uses a lot of temple terminology. But there will be no temple. Instead, the New Jerusalem is in the form of the Holy of Holies. This is a picture of being in the most intimate relationship with God, and another example of our total devotion, because right around it is hell (all in or all out).
- The nations: It is said that the nations will come in.
- Jews and the Church: There are elements that describe the Church and Israel and describe a reconciliation (that should happen before ;-)).

The point of the New Jerusalem is for all to have an intimate relationship with God as they did before the fall.

## And what about hell

<a name="570f"></a>
Well, hell is simply the absence of that: No relationship with God and with it all the blessings we take for granted now: hope, love, compassion, joy, peace. This is all gone because the courtship of God (where we get a foretaste of the real thing) is over and this is all gone.

So decide well after you have heard all this. What are you going to do? How will you live now?

### Reflection

<a name="27f7"></a>
- Why do you want to go to heaven?
- Would you want to spend eternity with God even if none of the other benefits were there (continued suffering, persecution, sickness, …)? If not, why not?
- Would you spend eternity with a person you couldn’t stand or didn’t care about, even if all your problems were gone?
- How does this vision of heaven shape the way you live your life now on earth?
