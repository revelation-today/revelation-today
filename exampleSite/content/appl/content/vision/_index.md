What do 2000 year old churches have to do with our situation today? Donâ€™t we have very different challenges today? You would be surprised how little the world and the church have changed.

## Our text

<a name="6e6b"></a>
We will take a very quick look at the {{% bible val="first three chapters of the book" link="rev:1" lang="en" %}} to establish some basics.

## Why do we need churches?

<a name="d73a"></a>
Is that a real question? Well, there are many reasons why we need churches

- It is the only place where believers can meet regularly to be encouraged in their lives.
- It is the place where you can receive blessings and teachings to help you manage your life and influence society.
- The most important task is to make churches grow so that everyone will be saved and we will all go to heaven.

Well, the book of Revelation agrees and focuses on the last point, but how is that supposed to happen? The book begins with a vision of Jesus himself describing the purpose of the church with two objects: stars and lamps. They describe the purpose of the church:

- To be a visible example and witness to the world
- Its strength lies in its dependence on Jesus.
