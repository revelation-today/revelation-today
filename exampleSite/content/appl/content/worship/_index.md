Worship is a key topic in the Book of Revelation. It is the place where all series (seals, trumpets and bowls) start.

It is the center of the book and shows the character of the "plagues". They are done with mercy and passion, but this will be revealed during the further study of the book.

Worship is also the place where the struggling churches find the answer and strength to face their battles.
