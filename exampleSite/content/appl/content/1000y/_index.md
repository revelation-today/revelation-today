The millennial kingdom is often described as a perfect world where the good rule and the evil is bound, and it happens before the new heaven and the new earth are in place. But is this the case?

## The 1000 years

<a name="ef5b"></a>
You may have heard a lot about this wonderful 1000 year kingdom. But before we start, let’s take a quick look together at what we actually have.

- This millennial kingdom has never been mentioned by that name anywhere in the Bible.
- We only have one verse that talks about it (verse 4).
- It is very vague: beheaded people who believe in Jesus will rule (how?) over who (the creation, each other, not so good Christians?).
- There is no reason given why the New Heaven and Earth could not begin, since this is not a disadvantage.

As you can see, it is difficult to draw conclusions from this short passage, and it is safer to assume that something is stated here that has been presented before.

I think the following is stated here:

- It begins with the death of Jesus on the cross, where Satan was defeated and cast out of heaven — the first coming of Jesus.
- Now, the Church is actually ruling by its witness, prayer and martyrdom, even its actions look weak — the time of the Church.
- When this time is over, Satan will put everything together, but he will fail terribly-Jesus’ second coming.

## What is the point?

<a name="7aa9"></a>
This part gives a brief summary of the essence of the message: The church is in control of the situation, even and especially when it suffers and seems to be at its end, like the church in Smyrna and Philadelphia, as long as it is faithful in its witness.

Even in her death she reigns (in former times only kings and other high people had the privilege of being beheaded, compared to other more cruel ways of execution).

### Reflection

<a name="ae6c"></a>
- Where in history and even today do you see the church ruling (in a positive sense)?
- What does good lordship look like?
- Where have you seen yourself (even unconsciously) treated as a king because you believe in Christ?
- What gives you hope to persevere?
