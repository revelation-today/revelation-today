We are now entering a chapter full of strange images and events. But the story is very simple and you know it very well.

## Our text

<a name="e630"></a>
We are moving quickly forward and reached {{% bible val="chapter 12" link="rev:12" lang="en" %}}.

## Christ is born

<a name="7fa6"></a>
The woman with sun, moon and stars giving birth to a child with an iron stuff attacked by a red dragon looks a bit puzzling, but it is the nativity story.

The woman is Israel who gives birth to Jesus who is attacked by the devil (dragon). And Jesus’ life was in danger from the moment he was born. It is not described in detail, but jumps directly to his ascension.

The devil is displayed as the big loser

- He cannot defeat a newborn child.
- While Jesus ascends to heaven, he is thrown out of heaven.
- He is unable to defeat Israel.
- His attempt to destroy the seed of Jesus (the Church) in the next chapter is also an epic failure.

But is this the reality? The devil does not look defeated. He seems to be in complete control of the earth and Christians are on the run.

But this chapter exposes that. The devil is causing as much damage as he can {{% bible val="BECAUSE he knows he is defeated" link="rev:12,11-12" lang="en" %}}. His display of power is an acknowledgment of his defeat.

And we should be aware of that. When we are attacked as Jesus was, it is not defeat. We should remain faithful and continue our witness.

In this chapter and the chapter before and after, you see strange times: 42 months, 1260 days, and 3.5 times. They all refer to the same time frame: 1260 days = 42 months (30 days per month) = 3.5 years (3.5 times). This describes all the same times between Jesus’ first and second coming.

We have the two witnesses acting in authority and the devil ruling. This happens at the same time that the victory of the Church is different from the victory of the Beast. The beast wants to destroy its enemies, but the Church wants to restore its enemies and its relationship with God, even if it means that the Church suffers and seems to be destroyed and defeated.

## So what does it mean for us

So what is the takeaway for us?

We often think of ourselves as either victors or defeated (maybe because we don’t have enough faith). But this is not true. This Christmas story shows that there is a difference between how our situation looks and how it will end.

We can be weak and feel helpless (and it’s okay to allow those feelings), but we don’t have to despair as long as we are faithful followers of Jesus.

### Reflection

<a name="e9a1"></a>
- Can you take some time and let this story play out? Try to imagine it! Feel with all the characters!
- Do you know similar stories in the Bible where the weak overcome?
- What does it mean to you to see Satan thrown out of heaven, but creating as much chaos as possible because he has so little time? How does this affect your life as a Christian?
- Can you see Satan as the perpetual loser in the world around you?
