The subject of prayer does not seem very prominent in Revelation. But a closer look reveals its essential role there.

## The fifth seal

<a name="c4f7"></a>
The fifth seal speaks of the souls under the altar after the exposure of Satan’s work to put an end to it. Their prayer is heard and Jesus comes in the sixth seal and answers their prayer (parallels the fourth trumpet).

These people (souls) come up again in chapter 7 where God is with them and comforts them as an answer to their prayer of the fifth seal.

## The trumpets

<a name="23eb"></a>
The seventh seal is the time when the prayers of the saints are presented and the prayers cause the trumpets to be blown.

Here, the prayer shows a similar effect as Jesus’ death for the seals and God’s wrath/ambition for the vials.

The prayers here take away the false security of the people, but also push the Church to be a witness.

## The bowls of wrath

<a name="ba03"></a>
The bowls have strong similarities to the trumpets, since both are based on the Exodus plagues.

This is another surprise: God’s plan depends on our prayers.

## Conclusion

<a name="7af2"></a>
Prayer has many aspects, but here it is not presented as

- Asking for our needs
- Praying for a good life for others and peace on earth.

But the prayers here are an alignment with God’s will so that they will be.

- Pray for the Church to endure in these times.
- Pray that all false securities will be exposed and that the church will be a good witness.
- Pray that they will grow closer to God.
- Pray for people’s hearts to be opened to God.
