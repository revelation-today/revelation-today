Understanding the Whore Babel is a bit complex as we saw in part 1, but the solution comes in part 2. Stay tuned!


## The religious aspect

It seems that the model for the harlot in [Revelation](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17) comes from Jeremiah 2/20–4/30:

- [Judah is called a harlot](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah2%3A20) with [a harlot’s forehead, acting without shame](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah3%3A3).
- She is [seducing others to sin](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah2%3A33).
- [The blood of the innocent is on her, and she feels innocent](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah2%3A34-35).
- [Her robe is scarlet, she decorates herself with gold](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah4%3A30).
- [But her lovers despise her and want to kill her](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah4%3A30).




But the harlot in Revelation is described in chapters [17](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A4) and [18](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation18%3A16) with similar materials as the high priest in the Old Testament:[the offering for the tabernacle](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Exodus25%3A3-7)[the ephod (undergarments)](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Exodus25%3A3-7)[the breastplate](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Exodus28%3A15-20)[but also in the temple](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/2%20Chronicles2%3A13-14)The plate of the high priest [with the inscription “Holy to the Lord”](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Exodus28%3A35-38) is also a counterpart to the name of the harlot on the forehead “[Babylon the great the mother of harlots and of the abominations of the earth](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A5)”.Furthermore was the [judgment for the daughter of a priest who became a prostitute was burned with fire](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Leviticus21%3A9) which was [also the judgment on Babel](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation18%3A8).In Ezekiel God confronts Jerusalem for [acting as a whore described in the same priestly garments](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Ezekiel16%3A13-26). In these passages, the harlot is portrayed as the high priest/lover of God who cheated.



In the Old Testament the following cities are described as harlots:Tyre which [made a covenant with God](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/1%20Kings5%3A12) to build the temple, but was [called to judgment for selling Jews into captivity](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Amos1%3A9) and was [called a harlot](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah23%3A15-18).Niniveh [humbled ifself before he Lord and He had mercy on them](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jonah3%3A5-10), but [later it was judged for being a harlot](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Nahum3%3A4-7).Israel has a covenant with God but failed so many times and was [called a harlot](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Ezekiel16%3A15-41) as in Ezekiel there political and economic dependence on other nations and the idolatry that they got from those nations identify it a whore.Again, the pattern is that the harlot is the turning away from a former relationship with God, but the turning away to idol worship.The warning is to the church not to be prostituted to the world like [Pergamon with Balaam](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation2%3A14) or [Thyatira with Jezebel](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation2%3A20-22).Rather, she should [be awake and viligent](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation16%3A15) and [self-aware](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation3%3A17-18) lest be [ashamed like Babel](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A16).The economic aspectThe term harlot refers to an illicit relationship, whether religious, political, economic or any combination, e.g. [Nineveh](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Nahum3%3A4-5) and [Tyre](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah23%3A15-18) are called whores because they brought ruin and defilement to the nations througheconomic oppression,influence through idol worship.Economic relationships often lead to religious relationships such as [temple gifts](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Micah1%3A7), [economic dependencies](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Nahum3%3A4) or [political influence (Jezebel married into another kingdom)](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/2%20Kings9%3A22).The strongest link to the a[dultery of Babel with the kings of the earth](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A2) is Tyre [which will ply her trade with all the kingdoms of the earth](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah23%3A17) (or [commit fornication with the kingdoms of the earth](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/isaiah/23-17.htm)). The [list of trade in Revelation ](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation18%3A12-13)is also [very similar to that of Tyre](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Ezekiel27).Tyre was the [port for the world and made everyone rich while being paid in naturalia (here with grain)](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah23%3A1-3). At the [end of the chapter she is described as a harlot, where her benefit from the wealth of the nation is her “harlot’s wage”](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah23%3A16-18).Also in Revelation the connection is made with the kings [who prostitute themselves with Babel](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation18%3A3) and [become rich as a result](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation18%3A9). The clothing and jewelry items (of the harlot) from the [trade list in Revelation](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Ezekiel27) are a symbol of wealth. So the harlot is tempting with wealth into idolatry as this [might attract](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah4%3A30) as [Jezebel tried](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/2%20Kings9%3A30).Is Babel the apostate church?Could it be that Babel is a reference to the church that has gone astray? Well, not really, but the church is always in danger of becoming part of Babel.Babel is the counterpart to the Bride/New Jerusalem and is itself a system. Together with the beast on which it sits on, it [represents the evil trinity to deceive the world](../../../content/beasts/expl/the-nature-of-the-beast-in-the-book-of-revelation). The beast on which the harlot sits represents the political and military power ([represented by the emperor](../../../content/beasts/expl/the-beasts-and-the-666-in-historical-context)), while the harlot represents the supporting system, which is theeconomy ([giving wealth or making poor](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A16-17)),culture with [impressive temple worship](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A13-15),[ideology](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A12),other aspects of daily such as [coins](../../../content/harlot/expl/the-whore-in-revelation-a-mocking-of-the-roman-empire), public holidays, etc.In all of this, it seeks to bring a better gospel than Jesus by providing[security](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A4) through fear of [war](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A7) or [persecution](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A10),wealth through [abuse of the weak](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation6%3A5-6) or [exclusion of the ones not compliant](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A16-17),[feeling superior](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A13-14),[silencing inconvenient voices](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A6).Since Babel has [many parallels to Jezebel](../../../content/harlot/expl/who-is-the-whore-babel-part-1), this maybe a special warning to church leaders. But the call to awareness and reflection is for everyone. Maybe that is the reason why Babel is not so clear, [so that you can reflect and move out of it every day again](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation18%3A4). Because Babel is everywhere!This could be compelling and attractive for the church when it is in persecution or poverty and on the way to more wealth and human appreciation.Further reading[Babel as mocking on the empire](../../../content/harlot/expl/the-whore-in-revelation-a-mocking-of-the-roman-empire)Dig DeeperBeale, Revelation, pages 847–890
