Understanding the Harlot Babylon is a bit complex as we saw in part 1, but the solution comes in part 2. Stay tuned!

## The religious aspect

<a name="89fc"></a>
It seems that the model for the harlot in {{% bible val="Revelation" link="rev:17" lang="en" %}} comes from Jeremiah 2/20–4/30:

- {{% bible val="Judah is called a harlot" link="jer:2,20" lang="en" %}} with {{% bible val="a harlot’s forehead, acting without shame" link="jer:3,3" lang="en" %}}.
- She is {{% bible val="seducing others to sin" link="jer:2,33" lang="en" %}}.
- {{% bible val="The blood of the innocent is on her, and she feels innocent" link="jer:2,34-35" lang="en" %}}.
- {{% bible val="Her robe is scarlet, she decorates herself with gold" link="jer:4,30" lang="en" %}}.
- {{% bible val="But her lovers despise her and want to kill her" link="jer:4,30" lang="en" %}}.

But the harlot in Revelation is described in chapters {{% bible val="17" link="rev:17,4" lang="en" %}} and {{% bible val="18" link="rev:18,16" lang="en" %}} with similar materials as the high priest in the Old Testament:{{% bible val="the offering for the tabernacle" link="exo:25,3-7" lang="en" %}}{{% bible val="the ephod (undergarments)" link="exo:25,3-7" lang="en" %}}{{% bible val="the breastplate" link="exo:28,15-20" lang="en" %}}{{% bible val="but also in the temple" link="2ch:2,13-14" lang="en" %}}.

The plate of the high priest {{% bible val="with the inscription “Holy to the Lord”" link="exo:28,35-38" lang="en" %}} is also a counterpart to the name of the harlot on the forehead “{{% bible val="Babylon the great the mother of harlots and of the abominations of the earth" link="rev:17,5" lang="en" %}}”.Furthermore was the {{% bible val="judgment for the daughter of a priest who became a prostitute was burned with fire" link="lev:21,9" lang="en" %}} which was {{% bible val="also the judgment on Babel" link="rev:18,8" lang="en" %}}.

In Ezekiel God confronts Jerusalem for {{% bible val="acting as a harlot described in the same priestly garments" link="ezk:16,13-26" lang="en" %}}. In these passages, the harlot is portrayed as the high priest/lover of God who cheated.

In the Old Testament the following cities are described as harlots:Tyre which {{% bible val="made a covenant with God" link="1ki:5,12" lang="en" %}} to build the temple, but was {{% bible val="called to judgment for selling Jews into captivity" link="amo:1,9" lang="en" %}} and was {{% bible val="called a harlot" link="isa:23,15-18" lang="en" %}}.Niniveh {{% bible val="humbled ifself before he Lord and He had mercy on them" link="jon:3,5-10" lang="en" %}}, but {{% bible val="later it was judged for being a harlot" link="nam:3,4-7" lang="en" %}}.

Israel has a covenant with God but failed so many times and was {{% bible val="called a harlot" link="ezk:16,15-41" lang="en" %}} as in Ezekiel there political and economic dependence on other nations and the idolatry that they got from those nations identify it a harlot.

Again, the pattern is that the harlot is the turning away from a former relationship with God, but the turning away to idol worship. The warning is to the church not to be prostituted to the world like {{% bible val="Pergamon with Balaam" link="rev:2,14" lang="en" %}} or {{% bible val="Thyatira with Jezebel" link="rev:2,20-22" lang="en" %}}.Rather, she should {{% bible val="be awake and viligent" link="rev:16,15" lang="en" %}} and {{% bible val="self-aware" link="rev:3,17-18" lang="en" %}} lest be {{% bible val="ashamed like Babel" link="rev:17,16" lang="en" %}}.

## The economic aspect

The term harlot refers to an illicit relationship, whether religious, political, economic or any combination, e.g. {{% bible val="Nineveh" link="nam:3,4-5" lang="en" %}} and {{% bible val="Tyre" link="isa:23,15-18" lang="en" %}} are called harlots because they brought ruin and defilement to the nations through economic oppression, influence through idol worship. 

Economic relationships often lead to religious relationships such as {{% bible val="temple gifts" link="mic:1,7" lang="en" %}}, {{% bible val="economic dependencies" link="nam:3,4" lang="en" %}} or {{% bible val="political influence (Jezebel married into another kingdom)" link="2ki:9,22" lang="en" %}}. The strongest link to the {{% bible val="adultery of Babel with the kings of the earth" link="rev:17,2" lang="en" %}} is Tyre {{% bible val="which will ply her trade with all the kingdoms of the earth" link="isa:23,17" lang="en" %}} (or [commit fornication with the kingdoms of the earth](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/isaiah/23-17.htm)). The {{% bible val="list of trade in Revelation" link="rev:18,12-13" lang="en" %}} is also {{% bible val="very similar to that of Tyre" link="ezk:27" lang="en" %}}. Tyre was the {{% bible val="port for the world and made everyone rich while being paid in naturalia (here with grain)" link="isa:23,1-3" lang="en" %}}. At the {{% bible val="end of the chapter she is described as a harlot, where her benefit from the wealth of the nation is her “harlot’s wage”" link="isa:23,16-18" lang="en" %}}. 

Also in Revelation the connection is made with the kings {{% bible val="who prostitute themselves with Babel" link="rev:18,3" lang="en" %}} and {{% bible val="become rich as a result" link="rev:18,9" lang="en" %}}. The clothing and jewelry items (of the harlot) from the {{% bible val="trade list in Revelation" link="ezk:27" lang="en" %}} are a symbol of wealth. So the harlot is tempting with wealth into idolatry as this {{% bible val="might attract" link="jer:4,30" lang="en" %}} as {{% bible val="Jezebel tried" link="2ki:9,30" lang="en" %}}. 

## Is Babel the apostate church? 

Could it be that Babel is a reference to the church that has gone astray? Well, not really, but the church is always in danger of becoming part of Babel. Babel is the counterpart to the Bride/New Jerusalem and is itself a system. Together with the beast on which it sits on, it {{% int_link val="represents the evil trinity to deceive the world" link="/content/beasts/expl/the-nature-of-the-beast-in-the-book-of-revelation" %}}. 

The beast on which the harlot sits represents the political and military power ({{% int_link val="represented by the emperor" link="/content/beasts/expl/the-beasts-and-the-666-in-historical-context" %}}), while the harlot represents the supporting system, which is theeconomy ({{% bible val="giving wealth or making poor" link="rev:13,16-17" lang="en" %}}),culture with {{% bible val="impressive temple worship" link="rev:13,13-15" lang="en" %}},{{% bible val="ideology" link="rev:13,12" lang="en" %}},other aspects of daily such as {{% int_link val="coins" link="/content/harlot/expl/the-harlot-in-revelation-a-mocking-of-the-roman-empire" %}}, public holidays, etc.In all of this, it seeks to bring a better gospel than Jesus by providing{{% bible val="security" link="rev:13,4" lang="en" %}} through fear of {{% bible val="war" link="rev:13,7" lang="en" %}} or {{% bible val="persecution" link="rev:13,10" lang="en" %}},wealth through {{% bible val="abuse of the weak" link="rev:6,5-6" lang="en" %}} or {{% bible val="exclusion of the ones not compliant" link="rev:13,16-17" lang="en" %}},{{% bible val="feeling superior" link="rev:13,13-14" lang="en" %}},{{% bible val="silencing inconvenient voices" link="rev:17,6" lang="en" %}}.

Since Babel has {{% int_link val="many parallels to Jezebel" link="/content/harlot/expl/who-is-the-harlot-babylon-part-1" %}}, this maybe a special warning to church leaders. But the call to awareness and reflection is for everyone. Maybe that is the reason why Babel is not so clear, {{% bible val="so that you can reflect and move out of it every day again" link="rev:18,4" lang="en" %}}. Because Babel is everywhere!

This could be compelling and attractive for the church when it is in persecution or poverty and on the way to more wealth and human appreciation.
