Understanding the Harlot Babylon is a bit complex as we saw in part 1, but the solution comes in part 2. Stay tuned!

## The religious aspect

<a name="89fc"></a>
It seems that the model for the harlot in {{% bible val="Revelation" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17" %}} comes from Jeremiah 2/20–4/30:

- {{% bible val="Judah is called a harlot" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah2%3A20" %}} with {{% bible val="a harlot’s forehead, acting without shame" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah3%3A3" %}}.
- She is {{% bible val="seducing others to sin" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah2%3A33" %}}.
- {{% bible val="The blood of the innocent is on her, and she feels innocent" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah2%3A34-35" %}}.
- {{% bible val="Her robe is scarlet, she decorates herself with gold" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah4%3A30" %}}.
- {{% bible val="But her lovers despise her and want to kill her" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah4%3A30" %}}.

But the harlot in Revelation is described in chapters {{% bible val="17" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A4" %}} and {{% bible val="18" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation18%3A16" %}} with similar materials as the high priest in the Old Testament:{{% bible val="the offering for the tabernacle" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Exodus25%3A3-7" %}}{{% bible val="the ephod (undergarments)" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Exodus25%3A3-7" %}}{{% bible val="the breastplate" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Exodus28%3A15-20" %}}{{% bible val="but also in the temple" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/2%20Chronicles2%3A13-14" %}}.

The plate of the high priest {{% bible val="with the inscription “Holy to the Lord”" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Exodus28%3A35-38" %}} is also a counterpart to the name of the harlot on the forehead “{{% bible val="Babylon the great the mother of harlots and of the abominations of the earth" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A5" %}}”.Furthermore was the {{% bible val="judgment for the daughter of a priest who became a prostitute was burned with fire" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Leviticus21%3A9" %}} which was {{% bible val="also the judgment on Babel" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation18%3A8" %}}.

In Ezekiel God confronts Jerusalem for {{% bible val="acting as a harlot described in the same priestly garments" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Ezekiel16%3A13-26" %}}. In these passages, the harlot is portrayed as the high priest/lover of God who cheated.

In the Old Testament the following cities are described as harlots:Tyre which {{% bible val="made a covenant with God" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/1%20Kings5%3A12" %}} to build the temple, but was {{% bible val="called to judgment for selling Jews into captivity" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Amos1%3A9" %}} and was {{% bible val="called a harlot" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah23%3A15-18" %}}.Niniveh {{% bible val="humbled ifself before he Lord and He had mercy on them" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jonah3%3A5-10" %}}, but {{% bible val="later it was judged for being a harlot" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Nahum3%3A4-7" %}}.

Israel has a covenant with God but failed so many times and was {{% bible val="called a harlot" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Ezekiel16%3A15-41" %}} as in Ezekiel there political and economic dependence on other nations and the idolatry that they got from those nations identify it a harlot.

Again, the pattern is that the harlot is the turning away from a former relationship with God, but the turning away to idol worship. The warning is to the church not to be prostituted to the world like {{% bible val="Pergamon with Balaam" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation2%3A14" %}} or {{% bible val="Thyatira with Jezebel" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation2%3A20-22" %}}.Rather, she should {{% bible val="be awake and viligent" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation16%3A15" %}} and {{% bible val="self-aware" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation3%3A17-18" %}} lest be {{% bible val="ashamed like Babel" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A16" %}}.

## The economic aspect

The term harlot refers to an illicit relationship, whether religious, political, economic or any combination, e.g. {{% bible val="Nineveh" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Nahum3%3A4-5" %}} and {{% bible val="Tyre" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah23%3A15-18" %}} are called harlots because they brought ruin and defilement to the nations through economic oppression, influence through idol worship. 

Economic relationships often lead to religious relationships such as {{% bible val="temple gifts" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Micah1%3A7" %}}, {{% bible val="economic dependencies" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Nahum3%3A4" %}} or {{% bible val="political influence (Jezebel married into another kingdom)" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/2%20Kings9%3A22" %}}. The strongest link to the {{% bible val="adultery of Babel with the kings of the earth" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A2" %}} is Tyre {{% bible val="which will ply her trade with all the kingdoms of the earth" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah23%3A17" %}} (or [commit fornication with the kingdoms of the earth](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/isaiah/23-17.htm)). The {{% bible val="list of trade in Revelation" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation18%3A12-13" %}} is also {{% bible val="very similar to that of Tyre" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Ezekiel27" %}}. Tyre was the {{% bible val="port for the world and made everyone rich while being paid in naturalia (here with grain)" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah23%3A1-3" %}}. At the {{% bible val="end of the chapter she is described as a harlot, where her benefit from the wealth of the nation is her “harlot’s wage”" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah23%3A16-18" %}}. 

Also in Revelation the connection is made with the kings {{% bible val="who prostitute themselves with Babel" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation18%3A3" %}} and {{% bible val="become rich as a result" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation18%3A9" %}}. The clothing and jewelry items (of the harlot) from the {{% bible val="trade list in Revelation" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Ezekiel27" %}} are a symbol of wealth. So the harlot is tempting with wealth into idolatry as this {{% bible val="might attract" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah4%3A30" %}} as {{% bible val="Jezebel tried" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/2%20Kings9%3A30" %}}. 

## Is Babel the apostate church? 

Could it be that Babel is a reference to the church that has gone astray? Well, not really, but the church is always in danger of becoming part of Babel. Babel is the counterpart to the Bride/New Jerusalem and is itself a system. Together with the beast on which it sits on, it {{% int_link val="represents the evil trinity to deceive the world" link="/content/beasts/expl/the-nature-of-the-beast-in-the-book-of-revelation" %}}. 

The beast on which the harlot sits represents the political and military power ({{% int_link val="represented by the emperor" link="/content/beasts/expl/the-beasts-and-the-666-in-historical-context" %}}), while the harlot represents the supporting system, which is theeconomy ({{% bible val="giving wealth or making poor" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A16-17" %}}),culture with {{% bible val="impressive temple worship" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A13-15" %}},{{% bible val="ideology" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A12" %}},other aspects of daily such as {{% int_link val="coins" link="/content/harlot/expl/the-harlot-in-revelation-a-mocking-of-the-roman-empire" %}}, public holidays, etc.In all of this, it seeks to bring a better gospel than Jesus by providing{{% bible val="security" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A4" %}} through fear of {{% bible val="war" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A7" %}} or {{% bible val="persecution" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A10" %}},wealth through {{% bible val="abuse of the weak" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation6%3A5-6" %}} or {{% bible val="exclusion of the ones not compliant" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A16-17" %}},{{% bible val="feeling superior" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A13-14" %}},{{% bible val="silencing inconvenient voices" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A6" %}}.

Since Babel has {{% int_link val="many parallels to Jezebel" link="/content/harlot/expl/who-is-the-harlot-babylon-part-1" %}}, this maybe a special warning to church leaders. But the call to awareness and reflection is for everyone. Maybe that is the reason why Babel is not so clear, {{% bible val="so that you can reflect and move out of it every day again" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation18%3A4" %}}. Because Babel is everywhere!

This could be compelling and attractive for the church when it is in persecution or poverty and on the way to more wealth and human appreciation.
