After understanding who the harlot is, there are still open questions that the Bible answers. What is her behavior and “tactic”? How should we behave? What causes her to fall?

## The character of the harlot

<a name="b96c"></a>
We saw in the introduction to the harlot, that the harlot reflects the economic system. We draw the parallel to Jezebel where the connection to idolatry and unrighteousness was seen.

The harlot sits on the {{% bible val="second beast of chapter 13" link="rev:13" lang="NIV" %}} which reflects military and political power. She covers the cruelty of the beast’s brute force with the allure of wealth. She makes the rulers drunk so that they will do her bidding. It works with perception as the second beast in chapter 13, it has control over money and can rule and destroy with it.

The list of good and also the mourning song are composed based on the song of Tyre. The king of {{% bible val="Tyre refers to the same type of stones" link="ezk:28,13" lang="NIV" %}} as the {{% bible val="New Jerusalem" link="rev:21,19-20" lang="NIV" %}}. The {{% bible val="stones in Tyre are linked to righteousness" link="ezk:28,12-18" lang="NIV" %}}.

When we look at the {{% bible val="list of goods" link="rev:18,12-13" lang="NIV" %}}, we see that people (souls) are listed like any other good. Reflection: What does it mean for companies to invest in their employees as their assets?

{{% bible val="She sees herself untouchable" link="rev:18,7" lang="NIV" %}} and non-destructible (you may be reminded of the government bailouts of banks).

So is economic growth and (related scientific research) bad? No, we need trade and exchange of goods and money for that, but what is the spirit behind it? And how do we react to it?

Do we mourn with the others {{% bible val="when the economy crumbles" link="rev:18,10" lang="NIV" %}} and our standard of living sinks? {{% bible val="When we lose jobs to other countries" link="rev:18,17" lang="NIV" %}}? When we support military interventions to secure our business? If so, we are in Babel {{% bible val="and must leave" link="rev:18,4" lang="NIV" %}}.

## The mystery of her fall

<a name="0a44"></a>
The end of Babel is very fascinating. She {{% bible val="sits on the beast" link="rev:17,3" lang="NIV" %}} and {{% bible val="controls the kings" link="rev:17,2" lang="NIV" %}}, but {{% bible val="they will destroy her" link="rev:17,16" lang="NIV" %}} and {{% bible val="then weep afterwards about it" link="rev:18,9" lang="NIV" %}}!?!

{{% bible val="The simple answer is that God put it in their minds" link="rev:17,17" lang="NIV" %}}. But there is more:

- People change their minds (today my friend, tomorrow my enemy), but God does not change. Babel relied on the support of the rulers, but this was deceptive. For in the end, everyone in this world looks out for his own advantage.
- This is a fulfillment of {{% bible val="Daniel" link="dan:7,21-22" lang="NIV" %}}, where evil defeats the saints, but God gives them the victory (a theme that runs throughout the book, such as with the witnesses or in the millennial kingdom). At the time when evil seems to be winning and showing its face, God turns the tables.
- The beast and the kings attack the saints, but Jesus defeats them. Jesus intervenes when the Church is attacked.
- The harlot looks like the bride from the outside, and this is intended when we look at the deception of the second beast (two horns like a lamb). So this could be the case of Satan falling for his own deception. The kings want to destroy the saints ({{% bible val="for obvious reasons" link="rev:11,6-10" lang="NIV" %}}) but they confuse the saints with the harlot and destroy her! But how can this be? [Major parts of the Western society and the successful economy (also worldwide) are built on christian foundations and values](https://www.pdfdrive.com/the-book-that-made-your-world-how-the-bible-created-the-soul-of-western-civilization-e200370906.html).

## The judgment

<a name="3d3b"></a>
The judgment is based on her actions:

- She considered herself untouchable -&gt; She will fall in an hour (very short time).
- She will be judged {{% bible val="with the same measure" link="rev:18,6" lang="NIV" %}} that {{% bible val="she inflicted on others" link="rev:18,22-24" lang="NIV" %}} ([the double measure is another way of saying the equivalent](https://meredithkline.com/klines-works/articles-and-essays/double-trouble/))
- She will be consumed by fire, which was the judgment when the daughter of a priest committed adultery, another strong warning to stay away from Babel and not to be attracted to it.
