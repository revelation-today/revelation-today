title: "Who is the Whore Babel: Part 1"
weight: 2

It is not the Pope. It is not the economy. It could be anyone, even the Church.

The chapter about the harlot Babel is hard to understand because there are so [many players interacting with each other](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17). Let us have a look at them.

It begins with the great harlot who intoxicates the kings and the whole earth, and now her secret is revealed. The first clue is that she sits on a beast ([from chapter 13](../../../content/beasts/expl/the-nature-of-the-beast-in-the-book-of-revelation)) that has 7 heads and 10 horns. The woman is identified as Babel. The 7 heads are 7 hills as well as 7 kings who rule one after the other while the beast is the 8th king. The 10 horns are 10 kings who rule at the same time and give all their power to the beast.

Now the beast fights against the saints, but Jesus will take up the fight and it ends with the beast and the kings hating and destroying the harlot.

There are too many players, but they are all needed to describe the prostitute. This chapter is a build up and now fully describes the devil. So let us break it down.


## The scarlet beast

<a name="9621"></a>
The beast has many parallels to the first beast in chapter 13.


| The first beast of Revelation 13 | The beast on Revelation 17 |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| [Has 7 heads and 10 horns](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C1) | [Has 7 heads and 10 horns](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C3) |
| [Head as if slaughtered, grows back](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C3) | [5 kings fallen, the seventh yet to come](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C10) |
| [Who can fight against the beast](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C4) | [Beast makes war on King of Kings](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C14) |
| [Speech of blasphemy](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C5-6) | [Blasphemous name](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C3) |
| [Fight against saints and defeat them](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C7) | 
[Fights against Lamb and is overcome](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C14) |
[Fight against whore and destroy](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C16).
			

<tr>
<td>[All who are not written in the book of life worship the beast](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C8)</td>
<td>[All who are not written in the book of life are overwhelmed](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C8)</td>
</tr>

This beast reflects the emperor with his military strength (perhaps even referring to [the second horseman who is waging war](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation6%3A3-4)). The scarlet color also describes the royal clothing.

The beast is described as “[once was, now is not, and yet will come up out of the Abyss and go to its destruction, … once was, now is not, and yet will come](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A8)” and “[once was, and now is not, …. and is going to his destruction](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A11)” is a mockery of God [who was and is and is to come](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation1%3A8) — the Eternal One.


## The seven hills and seven kings

<a name="2d9d"></a>
The seven hills on which the woman sits are the [seven hills](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A9) that describe Rome. Rome, in the view of the first readers, is the place of the emperor, who is praised as Lord of lords and King of kings as being equal to God. It is not the pope or anyone else who later lived in Rome!

On the other hand, hills can also mean kingdoms (since they are also interpreted as king, these would be the associated kingdoms). This is supported by the description of the greatest kingdom in [Isaiah](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah2%3A2), the description of [Babel as a mountain](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah51%3A25), the description of [Edom as its mountain,](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Ezekiel35%3A3) or the [mountain that filled the earth in Daniel as the new godly kingdom](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Daniel2%3A35).

[Who are the seven kings?](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A10) 5 were gone, one is now, and a seventh is still to come, but will reign only for a short time? They describe a chronological sequence and show that during this time the kings will support the beast. It is not necessarily tied to a strict count, but shows that the final countdown is not far away [to keep us alert](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation16%3A15).

Now the beast itself [comes as the 8th king which is one of the seven](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A11). Considering that Jesus was resurrected on the 8th day (the day after the Sabbath), and that we have the topic of the resurrection of the beast already[ in chapter 13](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A3-4) and [chapter 16](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation16%3A13) (frogs are related to Egyptian goddess Heqet, who is the goddess of birth and resurrection), we can see that the beast appears on the 8th day: He appears to be invincible. But this is a deception, because he is already revealed as “the one who was, who is not, and who goes to destruction”. Here it is confirmed that the beast is one of the seven — not a superhero.


## The 10 kings

<a name="6041"></a>
[The 10 kings are the 10 horns](http://The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast. 13 They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast.) that act at the same time, and they give their power to the beast’s agents, who submit to the beast’s agenda. They represent the beast’s power over the (potentially whole) world at that particular time. The number 10 could again be symbolic. In the context of the first readers, this could refer to the supporting kings of the Roman Empire.

Their purpose is to wage war against the Lamb, but things work out differently as we will see.


## The whore

<a name="1947"></a>
She has many parallels as a contrast to the bride in chapter 21 and the woman in chapter 12

and a lot of similarities with Jezebel, who causes also trouble in [Thyatira](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation2%3A20)

and finally many parallels with the second beast in chapter 13
<p>The whore and the second beast</p>

| [Can make fire fall from the sky](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C13) | [Will be directed by fire ](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C16) ([Offb.18/9](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation18%2C9)) |
| [All who do not worship it will be killed](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C15) | [Drink blood of the saints](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C6) |
| [Make a sign on forehead and hand](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C16) | [Has sign on forehead: Babel](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C5) |

| [Requires wisdom](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C18) | [Requires wisdom](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C9) |
<p>The power of the harlot is also reversed here into: while in chapter 13 she dropped fire from heaven, now she is destroyed by fire; while she makes a mark on her forehead, here she herself is branded on the forehead (like a slave)</p>
While the first beast supports the harlot in chapter 17, the second beast supports the first beast in chapter 13.
