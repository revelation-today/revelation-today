title: "Part 1: Who is the Harlot Babylon?"
weight: 2

Some people say, it is the Pope; some people say it is the economy. It could be anyone, even the Church. So who is the Harlot Babylon?

## Overview

Chapter 17 is about the Harlot Babylon but it is difficult to identify who she is, because there are [many characters in this chapter interacting with each other](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17). Let us have a look at them.

It begins with the Great Harlot with whom the kings commit adultery and she intoxicates the whole earth. Then the angel starts to reveal the mystery surrounding her. The first clue we get is that she sits on a beast ([from chapter 13](../../../content/beasts/expl/the-nature-of-the-beast-in-the-book-of-revelation)) that has 7 heads and 10 horns and the woman is identified as Babylon. The 7 heads are 7 hills or 7 kings who rule consequetively while the beast is the 8th king. The 10 horns are 10 kings who rule at the same time and give all their power to the beast.

Now the beast fights against the saints, but Jesus will take up the fight and it ends with the beast and the kings hating and destroying the harlot.

There are too many players, but they are all needed to describe the Harlot. This chapter is a build up and now fully describes the devil. So let us break it down.


## The scarlet Beast

<a name="9621"></a>
This beast has many parallels to the First Beast in chapter 13.

| [<span style="color:green;">Fights against</span> <span style="color:red;">saints and defeats them</span>](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C7) | [<span style="color:green;">Fights against</span> <span style="color:red;">Lamb and is overcome</span>](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C14) </br> [<span style="color:green;">Fights against</span> the <span style="color:red;">Harlot and destroys her</span>](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C16) |
| [<span style="color:green;">All who are not written in the book of life</span> <span style="color:red;">worship the beast</span>](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C8) | [<span style="color:green;">All who are not written in the book of life</span> <span style="color:red;">are overwhelmed</span>](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C8) |

This beast is also a picture of the Emperor including his military power. The scarlet color refers to royalty.

The beast is described three times in verses 8 and 11 as the one who
- [once was, now is not, and yet will come up out of the Abyss and go to its destruction](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A8)
- [once was, now is not, and yet will come](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A8)
- [once was, and now is not, ... is going to his destruction](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A11)

which is a parody on the description of God as the Eternal One who is described in Rev.1:8 as the One [who was and is and is to come](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation1%3A8).


## The seven hills and seven kings

<a name="2d9d"></a>
The seven hills on which the woman sits are the [seven hills](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A9) that describe Rome. Rome, in the view of the first readers, is the place of the emperor, who is praised as Lord of lords and King of kings as being equal to God. It is not the pope or anyone else who later lived in Rome!

On the other hand, hills can also mean kingdoms (since they are also interpreted as king, these would be the associated kingdoms). This is supported by the description of the greatest kingdom in [Isaiah](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah2%3A2), the description of [Babylon as a mountain](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah51%3A25), the description of [Edom as its mountain,](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Ezekiel35%3A3) or the [mountain that filled the earth in Daniel as the new godly kingdom](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Daniel2%3A35).

[Who are the seven kings?](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A10) 5 were gone, one is now, and a seventh is still to come, but will reign only for a short time? They describe a chronological sequence and show that during this time the kings will support the beast. It is not necessarily tied to a strict count, but shows that the final countdown is not far away [to keep us alert](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation16%3A15).

Now the beast itself [comes as the 8th king which is one of the seven](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A11). Considering that Jesus was resurrected on the 8th day (the day after the Sabbath), and that we have the topic of the resurrection of the beast already[ in chapter 13](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%3A3-4) and [chapter 16](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation16%3A13) (frogs are related to Egyptian goddess Heqet, who is the goddess of birth and resurrection), we can see that the beast appears on the 8th day: He appears to be invincible. But this is a deception, because he is already revealed as “the one who was, who is not, and who goes to destruction”. Here it is confirmed that the beast is one of the seven — not a superhero.


## The 10 kings

<a name="6041"></a>
[The 10 kings are the 10 horns](http://The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast. 13 They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast.) that act at the same time, and they give their power to the beast’s agents, who submit to the beast’s agenda. They represent the beast’s power over the (potentially whole) world at that particular time. The number 10 could again be symbolic. In the context of the first readers, this could refer to the supporting kings of the Roman Empire.

Their purpose is to wage war against the Lamb, but things work out differently as we will see.


## The Harlot

<a name="1947"></a>
She has many parallels as a contrast to the bride in chapter 21 and the woman in chapter 12

and a lot of similarities with Jezebel, who causes also trouble in [Thyatira](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation2%3A20)

and finally many parallels with the second beast in chapter 13
<p>The whore and the second beast</p>


| The second beast of Revelation 13 | The harlot |
|-----------------------------------|------------|
| [Comes from Earth](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C11) | [Sits in desert](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C3) |

| [Acts in power of the (first) beast](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C12) | [Sits on the (first) beast](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C3) |
| [Can make fire fall from the sky](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C13) | [Will be directed by fire ](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C16) ([Offb.18/9](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation18%2C9)) |
| [All who do not worship it will be killed](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C15) | [Drink blood of the saints](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C6) |
| [Make a sign on forehead and hand](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C16) | [Has sign on forehead: Babylon](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C5) |

| [Requires wisdom](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C18) | [Requires wisdom](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C9) |
<p>The power of the harlot is also reversed here into: while in chapter 13 she dropped fire from heaven, now she is destroyed by fire; while she makes a mark on her forehead, here she herself is branded on the forehead (like a slave)</p>
While the first beast supports the harlot in chapter 17, the second beast supports the first beast in chapter 13.
