Who is the Harlot? The Book of Revelation leaves this a bit open so that we can check regularly ourselves if it is us. 

This is the most detailed description of Satan and his work and his involvement in the world and the dangers for the church. But it contains also a lot of mockery against the Roman empire or whatever this represents today.

The main point of the description of the harlot is the describe how the bride of Christ should definitely not be.
