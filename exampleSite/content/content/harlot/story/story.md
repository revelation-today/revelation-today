[Chapter 17–19](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17)

<a name="517a"></a>
There is one more and a dark mystery that needs to be revealed until the goal is reached. And it becomes very clear that the goal is not to defeat the devil but the union of God with his people.

It is the perfect deception of the church: A beautiful woman blessing the whole world with prosperity. It is ornamented with the jewels of the church and many are part of it. But if you lift the dress it reveals the beast — the strong enforcer of the devil. And this woman is not the bride of Christ but a harlot.

Many are deceived but this perfect charade. This last attack seemed to be perfect. But the opposite is the case. The people are directed by the devil to attack the church are guided by Jesus to destroy the harlot instead.

Now the way is free to finally destroy the devil and his minions.
