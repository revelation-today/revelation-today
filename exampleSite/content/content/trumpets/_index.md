The trumpets directly follow the description of the seals (the last seal is just opened).

The prayer of the saints is happening before and causes the trumpets to be blown. It is our prayer and has this massive impact.

The trumpets will take away all securities (food, trade, orientation, health, hope, live), but people decide to hold on to the demons that turture them (5th and 6th trumpets are caused by demons).
