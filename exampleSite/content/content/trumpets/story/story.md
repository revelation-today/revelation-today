It is time for the church to launch its power. With the same force as Jesus as the crucified shakes the world, the prayer of the church does the same. They cause the trumpet sound that shakes the earth. Food, water, trade, security — all is gone. Will this drive the people to look for the real deal. No! The stick to their idols.

They don’t even let loose when their idols turn against them and make them loose hope itself, so that they would rather end their lives but cannot and finally they do it. The church is protected — they will not give up. But the people suffer tremendously but they still stick to their idols.
