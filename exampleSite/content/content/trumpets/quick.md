{{% bible val="Chapter 8" link="rev:8" lang="en" %}} and {{% bible val="9" link="rev:9" lang="en" %}}.

## The Prayer

This chapter starts with the last seal and introduces the trumpets. After the last seal is a time of silence in heaven. In jewish literature this typically means the time when God listens to the prayers of the saints.

This is what follows but there is an important element to consider: The angels who have been told to blow their trumpets - wait.  Why? They are waiting for the prayers of the saints to be presented to God.

What a statement!  The prayers of the saints cause the trumpets to be sounded and the ensuing events. Just as Jesus' death on the cross caused the seals to be opened and the Wrath of God the bowls to be poured out. John the writer is making a statement about the importance of prayer.

## The Trumpets

The trumpets when sounded, effect mainly one thing: They strip away all securities that people have
- water
- food
- orientation
- trade/economy

When initiated by the demonic being, they take away from the people: 
- health and hope
- life itself

Yet after all that happens, the people still do not change their hearts. Instead, they cling still to the same demons that took away their hope, well being and life. The trumpets seem to be a dead end and do not effect a change. Instead they are even more closed to God than before. Suffering, pain and loss don't seem to bring anything. So what does? The Solution is in the next chapter when the second Mystery of God is revealed. Before this, let us take a look at how the church is affected when the trumpets are blown.

She is protected ({{% bible val="by the seal" link="rev:7,1-4" lang="en" %}}) from the {{% bible val="fifth trumpet" link="rev:9,4-6" lang="en" %}} - they will not lose hope while endurung all the trouble and even losing their lives. It is in enduring all the loss of the same securites and even their lives that make this a great testimony - exposing what is real security.
