[Chapter 20–22](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation20)

<a name="a287"></a>
It is done. Finally! You may have not noticed it but the church was always in power but with a different power and guided the fate of humanity. But first come the final judgment who will join eternity with God and who without him.

After this the bride meets the groom and join him for all eternity.

And, have you understood the story. Than go ahead and live accordingly in your daily life.
