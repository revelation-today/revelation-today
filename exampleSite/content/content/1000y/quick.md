## Overview

The 1000 year kingdom or the Millenium has sparked many discussion but actually is only mentioned in one verse in the whole Bible.

It is by soem considered as a time for special individuals to reign for a long time before we are all in heaven.

Here is the proposal I find most convincing:
- This vision starts with Jesus victory on the cross where Satan is bound
- This give the church the opportunity to share the gospel. The church rules in this time, but not like the world rules.
- After this Satan will have a big showdown which is described with the picture of the final battle of Gog and Magog.
- Now the resurrection happens and the final judgment will happen before we all spend the eternity either with God or without him.

The 1000 years are another way of describing the time between Jesus first and second coming and describes a church that should not be in victim mentality but should in confidence act and be a testimony. Before in the book it is lengthly described that the church can and should rule without violence, fear or manipulation.

Even the church acts in weakness, the church rules.

## Special questions

Neden {{% bible val="başı kesilmiş" link="rev:20,4" lang="NIV" %}} ifadesine yer verilmiştir? 

The death sentence in this time means that people are basically turtured to death over a long time. The privilege of a quick death (beheading) was only given to high nobles like kings. So this expression states that in our death we are treated as kings.

{{% bible val="Birinci ve ikinci ölüm/diriliş" link="rev:20,5-6" lang="NIV" %}} nedir?

The first refers to our original life while the second refers to all the things when we are newborn. We start a new life (the old is gone) and we will experience the second resurrection as we have a second life.
