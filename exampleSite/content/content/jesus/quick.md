[Chapter 12](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation12)).

## Satans constant failing

The story starts with another christmas story: The woman (Israel) gives birth to Jesus (the child), which Satan (the dragon) with the help of all of his fallen angels (third of the stars) tries to destroy as soon as Jesus is born (killing by Herod).

But Jesus finally overcomes and is ascended to heaven.

Now lets turn this around from the heavenly perspective: Michael who is linked to the son of man (Jesus) in the second half of Daniel fights with Satan who is now thrown out of heaven. Side note: The conquering of Satan was also done by the testimony of the saints.

Agnry as he is, Satan tries to destroy Israel who give birth to Jesus, but also this fails. The stream out of his mouth remind on the exodus through the Red Sea which the earth swallowed so that Israel could pass through and the eagles wings is a [promise from Isaiah](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah40%3A31).

Now Satan assembles two beasts to attack the seed of the child who follow Jesus (the church). Well you can guess how this ends. Satan failed in everything he did.

## The tribulation

After Satan was thrown out of heaven, it is said, [that this are bad news for the people on earth](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation12%3A12). After his defeat you would expect that Satan stays low, but the opposite is the case. He has only little time so he creates as much damage as possible.

So instead of an easy life we have now unprovoked attacks of Satan, which is also called the Great Tribulation: We suffer without doing anything wrong.
