{{% bible val="Chapter 6–7" link="rev:6" lang="en" %}}

<a name="c33e"></a>
Jesus is not the only one intending to rule this world and Jesus breaks the seals to reveal this. Satan claims the same and shows up in shiny armor, but Jesus shows that behind all this promises lies violence towards people that go along, live threatening injustice as consequence ending up in a total disaster.

Not that the church is excluded from this. No, she is in the middle of it and cries out to God. But we, the church, have to remain until Jesus comes and ends it all.

Until this we need to join the army of God. But what does it looks like? Our fight is not with violence as the devil but it is an army of worshipers that endure anything out of the love for their Lord.
