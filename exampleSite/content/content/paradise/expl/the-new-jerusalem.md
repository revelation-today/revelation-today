What will heaven be like and what will hell be like? This is hard to say in detail, but the book of Revelation gives us some insight.

## The structure of the chapter

<a name="aecd"></a>
The chapter has a similar feature as the {{% bible val="lion" link="rev:5,5" lang="NIV" %}} who is the {{% bible val="lamb" link="rev:5,6" lang="NIV" %}} or {{% bible val="the army of God" link="rev:7,4-8" lang="NIV" %}} who are the {{% bible val="worshipers from all the nations coming from the Great Tribulation" link="rev:7,9-17" lang="NIV" %}}.

Here John {{% bible val="hears about the bride of God" link="rev:21,9" lang="NIV" %}} who he {{% bible val="sees as the New Jerusalem" link="rev:21,10" lang="NIV" %}} which shows that this is not a literal description (women and towns are significantly different), but a symbolic description and a strong emphasis to not neglect that we have Jewish roots.

We can structure the passage as follows:

21/1–8: Introduction to the New Jerusalem which is summary of the subsequent passage (similarly to {{% bible val="Isa. 60" link="isa:60,1-20" lang="NIV" %}})

- 21/2 -&gt; 21/9–11
- 21/3 -&gt; 21/22–24; 22/3
- 21/6 -&gt; 22/1
- 21/8 -&gt; 21/27a

22/9–22/5: The New Jerusalem

- 21/9–14: first impression of the town
- 21/15–17: measurements of the town
- 21/18–21: material of the town
- 21/22–27: internal features of the town
- 22/1–5: symbols of Gods presence

## Introduction of the New Jerusalem

<a name="f50f"></a>

### Everything is new

<a name="e5bc"></a>
“{{% bible val="Then I saw ‘a new heaven and a new earth,’ for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea." link="rev:21,1" lang="NIV" %}}”

“New” is not just referring to something new, but describes a quality: The first is {{% bible val="temporary but the new is permanent" link="isa:66,22" lang="NIV" %}}.

Here {{% bible val="many of the Old Testament promises will be fulfilled" link="isa:65,17-25" lang="NIV" %}}.

### No more sea

<a name="a258"></a>
It is said, that there {{% bible val="will be no more a sea" link="rev:21,1" lang="NIV" %}}. The sea is

- the place of the origin of evil as in {{% bible val="Revelation" link="rev:13,1" lang="NIV" %}} or by describing the sea monsters {{% bible val="Leviathan" link="psa:74,13-14" lang="NIV" %}} or {{% bible val="Rahab" link="isa:51,9-10" lang="NIV" %}} or by personifying evil kings as sea monsters like {{% bible val="Pharaoh" link="ezk:32,2" lang="NIV" %}}, evil kings in general, or the {{% bible val="sea itself as an evil medium" link="psa:93,3-4" lang="NIV" %}}.
- {{% bible val="the place of the death" link="rev:20,13" lang="NIV" %}} along with Hades.

So if there is no more sea, then there is no place where evil can dwell and oppress the faithful. The {{% bible val="sea is rather outside of the town" link="rev:20,14-15" lang="NIV" %}}.

### Jerusalem the Holy town

<a name="c358"></a>
“{{% bible val="I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband." link="rev:21,2" lang="NIV" %}}”

Jerusalem is the {{% bible val="beautiful dressed town in Isaiah" link="isa:52,1-10" lang="NIV" %}}, which {{% bible val="is further developed" link="isa:61,10" lang="NIV" %}} which {{% bible val="gets a new name" link="isa:62,1-2" lang="NIV" %}} and {{% bible val="has an intimate relationship with God — God rejoices over her" link="isa:62,3-5" lang="NIV" %}}.

This thought is picked up in the New Testament as

- {{% bible val="God has prepared a city for the faithful" link="heb:11,13-16" lang="NIV" %}}
- {{% bible val="we have a citizenship in heaven" link="php:3,20" lang="NIV" %}}
- {{% bible val="there is a heavenly Jerusalem" link="heb:12,22" lang="NIV" %}}
- {{% bible val="Jerusalem is free" link="gal:4,26-31" lang="NIV" %}}

The is an interesting parallel to {{% bible val="verses 10 and 11" link="rev:21,10-11" lang="NIV" %}}:

Verse 2: new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband

Verse 10–11: Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. It shone with the glory of God

The beautiful dress of the bride is the glory of God. And {{% bible val="Gods glory is His mercy and compassion" link="exo:33,17-23" lang="NIV" %}} which also the church should reflect

### God lives with the people

<a name="93e0"></a>
“{{% bible val="And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, ‘Look! God’s dwelling-place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God." link="rev:21,3" lang="NIV" %}}”

The loud voice was there before in the {{% bible val="judgment of the kingdom of Satan " link="rev:16,17" lang="NIV" %}}and the {{% bible val="judgment of Babel" link="rev:19,5" lang="NIV" %}}.

That God lives with his people is a {{% bible val="promise in the Pentateuch" link="lev:26,11-12" lang="NIV" %}}, picked up in {{% bible val="Ezekiel" link="ezk:37,27" lang="NIV" %}}, when he {{% bible val="returns to the temple" link="ezk:43,7" lang="NIV" %}} and {{% bible val="even including the nations" link="zec:2,10-11" lang="NIV" %}}. This is also a topic in the {{% bible val="New Testament" link="2co:6,16" lang="NIV" %}} and in Revelation.

### Wipe away the tears

<a name="cbf4"></a>
“{{% bible val="“He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death” or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.’" link="rev:21,4" lang="NIV" %}}”

This is another promise form {{% bible val="Isaiah, where tears and death flee" link="isa:25,8" lang="NIV" %}}, but also {{% bible val="crying" link="isa:35,10" lang="NIV" %}} and {{% bible val="sighing" link="isa:51,11" lang="NIV" %}}.

The {{% bible val="first will be gone with all its mourning" link="isa:65,17-20" lang="NIV" %}} and we {{% bible val="should with this vision not look back but forward" link="isa:43,18" lang="NIV" %}}.

### All things new

<a name="ad18"></a>
“{{% bible val="He who was seated on the throne said, ‘I am making everything new!’ Then he said, ‘Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.’" link="rev:21,5" lang="NIV" %}}”

{{% bible val="All things new" link="isa:43,18-19" lang="NIV" %}} is fulfilled in {{% bible val="Jesus who started with us the new creation" link="2co:5,17" lang="NIV" %}}.

### Living water

<a name="bac3"></a>
“{{% bible val="He said to me: ‘It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life." link="rev:21,6" lang="NIV" %}}”

This is the fulfillment from {{% bible val="Isaiah" link="isa:49,10" lang="NIV" %}}, where God gives for free to drink. The Term “[without cost](https://biblehub.com/greek/1432.htm)” is used in {{% bible val="John" link="jhn:15,25" lang="NIV" %}}, {{% bible val="Matthew" link="mat:10,8" lang="NIV" %}}, the epistle to the {{% bible val="Corinthians" link="2co:11,7" lang="NIV" %}}, {{% bible val="Galatians" link="gal:2,21" lang="NIV" %}}, {{% bible val="Romans" link="rom:3,24" lang="NIV" %}} and the {{% bible val="Thessalonians" link="2th:3,8" lang="NIV" %}} and very often used with gift for free.

The living water has it source in {{% bible val="God" link="jer:2,13" lang="NIV" %}}, he {{% bible val="gives abundant to drink" link="psa:36,8-9" lang="NIV" %}}, even {{% bible val="overflowing" link="jol:3,18" lang="NIV" %}} and of course fulfilled in Jesus with the {{% bible val="woman on the well" link="jhn:4,10" lang="NIV" %}} and as {{% bible val="a promise to all believers in him" link="jhn:7,38" lang="NIV" %}}.

### The overcomer

<a name="e8f9"></a>
“{{% bible val="Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children." link="rev:21,7" lang="NIV" %}}”

{{% bible val="Isaiah links the covenant with God with the water to drink" link="isa:55,1-3" lang="NIV" %}}.

The churches that overcome in chapter 2 and 3 will see here the promises

- {{% bible val="Ephesus" link="rev:2,7" lang="NIV" %}} is promised to eat {{% bible val="from the tree of life" link="rev:22,2" lang="NIV" %}}
- {{% bible val="Philadelphia" link="rev:3,12" lang="NIV" %}} is promised to be a {{% bible val="pillar in the new temple" link="rev:21,22-24" lang="NIV" %}}, be {{% bible val="part of the New Jerusalem" link="rev:21,2" lang="NIV" %}} and {{% bible val="Gods name is written on them" link="rev:22,4" lang="NIV" %}}
- {{% bible val="Sardes" link="rev:3,5" lang="NIV" %}} is promised to be {{% bible val="in the book of life" link="rev:21,27" lang="NIV" %}} and have {{% bible val="white clothes" link="rev:21,2" lang="NIV" %}}
- {{% bible val="Pergamon" link="rev:2,17" lang="NIV" %}} and {{% bible val="Thyatira" link="rev:2,28" lang="NIV" %}} are promised to have a {{% bible val="light stone" link="rev:21,11" lang="NIV" %}}({{% bible val="s" link="rev:21,18-21" lang="NIV" %}}).
- {{% bible val="Thyatira" link="rev:2,26-27" lang="NIV" %}} and {{% bible val="Laodicea" link="rev:3,21" lang="NIV" %}} are promised to {{% bible val="rule with Jesus" link="rev:22,5" lang="NIV" %}}
- {{% bible val="Smyrna" link="rev:2,11" lang="NIV" %}} is promised to be {{% bible val="excluded from the second death" link="rev:21,7-8" lang="NIV" %}}

### Ready for the second death

<a name="0819"></a>
“{{% bible val="But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practise magic arts, the idolaters and all liars — they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulphur. This is the second death.’" link="rev:21,8" lang="NIV" %}}”

The list of these people are counterparts to the {{% bible val="overcomers" link="rev:21,7" lang="NIV" %}}.

[Cowardly](https://biblehub.com/greek/1169.htm) are the ones {{% bible val="who don’t act out of fear" link="mat:8,26" lang="NIV" %}} and is the counterpart {{% bible val="to have peace" link="jhn:14,27-29" lang="NIV" %}}, {{% bible val="trust in God" link="jhn:14,1" lang="NIV" %}} and {{% bible val="know that God never leaves them" link="jhn:16,31-33" lang="NIV" %}}.

“Murderer, sexual immoral, those who practise magic arts and idolaters” can be unbelievers or people in the church that compromise like in {{% bible val="Pergamon" link="rev:2,14" lang="NIV" %}} and {{% bible val="Thyatira" link="rev:2,20-21" lang="NIV" %}}.

They are all linked to idolatry:

- murderer like {{% bible val="sacrifice children" link="psa:106,36-38" lang="NIV" %}} or {{% bible val="killing believers" link="rev:13,15" lang="NIV" %}}
- sexually immoral linked to temple prostitution
- practise magic arts {{% bible val="links with idolatry" link="deu:18,9-11" lang="NIV" %}} also with {{% bible val="Jesebel" link="2ki:9,22" lang="NIV" %}}

Liars have betrayed the faith as {{% bible val="they call themselves apostels" link="rev:2,2" lang="NIV" %}}, {{% bible val="act in Satans way" link="rev:3,9" lang="NIV" %}}, {{% bible val="bring false testimony" link="act:6,13" lang="NIV" %}}, {{% bible val="disobeying his Jesus word" link="1jn:2,4" lang="NIV" %}}, {{% bible val="denies that Jesus is Lord" link="1jn:2,22" lang="NIV" %}}, {{% bible val="who hates his brothers or sisters" link="1jn:4,20" lang="NIV" %}} and who {{% bible val="don’t believe we have eternal life in Jesus" link="1jn:5,10" lang="NIV" %}}.

The list is repeated {{% bible val="at the very end" link="rev:22,15" lang="NIV" %}} and in a {{% bible val="shorter version at the end of the chapter" link="rev:21,27" lang="NIV" %}}, but in all cases ends with liar as it is {{% bible val="important that we are consistent with our words and deeds" link="tit:1,16" lang="NIV" %}}.

The {{% bible val="ultimate liar is Satan" link="jhn:8,44" lang="NIV" %}} and we want to be very distinguished from him.

## Details of the New Jerusalem

<a name="8e75"></a>

### {{% bible val="First look" link="rev:21,9-14" lang="NIV" %}}

<a name="946d"></a>
The New Jerusalem is the counterpart to Babel when we look at the {{% int_link val="larger context" link="/content/1000y/expl/the-thousand-year-kingdom" %}}. The {{% bible val="New Jerusalem represents a woman (the bride)" link="rev:21,2" lang="NIV" %}} just as Babel represents one (the harlot), which is also reflected in {{% bible val="Isaiah" link="isa:62,1-5" lang="NIV" %}}.

- Babel is the economic system distributed with the power of the ruler, and immorality is done with idolatry (unfaithfulness), but Gods people are faithful to him
- Babel causes suffering while Jerusalem removes suffering
- Babel destroys itself and Jerusalem stays forever
- Babel gets rich by exploitation and persecution but Jerusalem is rich as Gods gift

The twelve gates refer to the 12 tribes and the 12 foundation stones refer to the 12 apostel. The {{% bible val="2 times 12 reflect the eternal worship in heaven" link="rev:4,4" lang="NIV" %}}, but also is a reminder to look for reconciliation between Jews and Non-Jews which {{% int_link val="conflict is described throughout the book" link="/background/israel/expl/israel-and-the-church" %}}.

The strange thing is that the apostel are the foundation of the tribes (church foundation for Israel), but this {{% bible val="makes sense when looking that Jesus the fulfillment of Israel is which is worked out by the church" link="eph:2,20" lang="NIV" %}}. Judah is in the {{% bible val="book also listed as the first of tribes reflecting Jesus" link="rev:7,4-8" lang="NIV" %}}.

### {{% bible val="The measurement of the city" link="rev:21,15-17" lang="NIV" %}}

<a name="5b7b"></a>
The measuring of the city is based on {{% bible val="Ezekiel" link="ezk:40,3-5" lang="NIV" %}} which shows the {{% bible val="security" link="deu:3,5" lang="NIV" %}} against {{% bible val="destructive forces" link="rev:21,27" lang="NIV" %}} and is a contrast to the old Jerusalem which walls were destroyed.

In Ezekiel the temple is {{% bible val="measured as square" link="ezk:45,2-3" lang="NIV" %}} while the {{% bible val="town has a different shape but the temple in the middle" link="ezk:48,8-13" lang="NIV" %}}.

In Zechariah God measures the {{% bible val="city" link="zec:2,2" lang="NIV" %}}, so that {{% bible val="people find refuge" link="zec:2,6" lang="NIV" %}} as {{% bible val="God has mercy again over Jerusalem" link="zec:1,16" lang="NIV" %}}.

As you see much of the language in this chapter is taken from the description of the temple, especially from the last 9 chapters of Ezekiel.

But {{% bible val="there will be no temple" link="rev:21,22" lang="NIV" %}}.

When you look further you will see the strange shape of the city, which is a {{% bible val="cubicle" link="rev:21,16" lang="NIV" %}}. If you look in the Old Testament, you will find only one object with this shape: {{% bible val="The Holy of Holies" link="2ch:3,8" lang="NIV" %}}. Why is that?

Because that was a problem with the temple: God stayed in the Holy of Holies and the farther you are away from that, the farther you are from God.

Now everyone is closest to God. But not only that. All {{% bible val="the unbelievers are outside the city" link="rev:22,14-15" lang="NIV" %}} which means outside of the Holy of Holies, which means: You are either completely in or completely out.

Another aspect is that the size of the city is about the size of the Hellenistic world (Roman Empire) at that time, so there is room for everyone who is willing to enter.

### {{% bible val="The material of the city" link="rev:21,18-21" lang="NIV" %}}

<a name="73fd"></a>
The material reminds on the {{% bible val="restoration of Jerusalem after her suffering" link="isa:54" lang="NIV" %}}. The reference to {{% bible val="gold reflects Gods glory" link="1ki:6,20-22" lang="NIV" %}} (of all the stones {{% bible val="like jasper" link="rev:21,11" lang="NIV" %}}).

The 12 stones reflect the {{% bible val="breast piece of the high priest" link="exo:28,17-20" lang="NIV" %}} (which {{% bible val="contain the lots to ask for God will" link="exo:28,30" lang="NIV" %}} and is {{% bible val="square" link="exo:28,16" lang="NIV" %}}). Each {{% bible val="stone represent one tribe of Israel" link="exo:28,21" lang="NIV" %}}. Now {{% bible val="these represent the 12 apostels" link="rev:21,14" lang="NIV" %}}. We are also called {{% bible val="living stone on Gods house" link="1pe:2,5" lang="NIV" %}}.

Interesting is that also the {{% bible val="temple of Solomon is build with four rows of stones" link="1ki:7,9-12" lang="NIV" %}} as the {{% bible val="breast piece" link="exo:28,17" lang="NIV" %}}.

Our translation says that the “the first foundations is decorated with jasper”, but a [better translation is “the first foundation IS jasper”](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/21-19.htm).

The mention of the {{% bible val="street in the New Jerusalem" link="rev:21,21" lang="NIV" %}} reminds of {{% bible val="the two witnesses who’s dead body were exposes" link="rev:11,8" lang="NIV" %}}, but now the street is in honor of them. Our former shame will be replace by eternal glory.

### {{% bible val="The internal features" link="rev:21,22-27" lang="NIV" %}}

<a name="bf9a"></a>
The statement {{% bible val="that the city don’t need sun or moon" link="rev:21,23" lang="NIV" %}} is a reference to {{% bible val="Isaiah" link="isa:60,19" lang="NIV" %}}, where the last passage “your God will be your glory” is replaced by “Lamb is its lamp”, so Jesus is Gods [glory/beauty](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_8597.htm). This is also the fulfillment of {{% bible val="verses 2 and 5 of Ezekiel 43" link="ezk:43,2-5" lang="NIV" %}}.

The {{% bible val="statement that the nations will come and bring their splendour and glory and honor into the city" link="rev:21,24-26" lang="NIV" %}} can be better understood looking at {{% bible val="Isaiah" link="isa:60,3-11" lang="NIV" %}}, where the same phrases are used but glory and honor is replaced there with wealth.

“{{% bible val="Nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn. …, to you the riches of the nations will come" link="isa:60,3-5" lang="NIV" %}}.”

“{{% bible val="The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendour into it" link="rev:21,24" lang="NIV" %}}.”

and

“{{% bible val="Your gates will always stand open, they will never be shut, day or night, so that people may bring you the wealth of the nations — their kings led in triumphal procession." link="isa:60,11" lang="NIV" %}}”

“{{% bible val="On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there. 26 The glory and honour of the nations will be brought into it." link="rev:21,25-26" lang="NIV" %}}”

In Isaiah they bring their wealth to acknowledge that God is with Israel and {{% bible val="will therefore not suffer with others" link="isa:60,12" lang="NIV" %}}. They are coming to bring the good news from the salvation by God.

The statement “{{% bible val="I will extend peace to her like a river, and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream" link="isa:66,12" lang="NIV" %}}” in a later passage also links the gift of the nations to peace with Israel.

The glory and honor and splendour is not what is an attribute of the nations but what they give God (not {{% bible val="their own glory/riches as they get from Babel" link="rev:18,3" lang="NIV" %}}).

{{% bible val="They will bring themselves to serve God" link="rev:22,3-5" lang="NIV" %}}.

But who are these kings? Will all nations be saved? It seems that some of them repent and give God the glory but unfortunately not all. The {{% bible val="context in Isaiah which we look at before describes good and bad kings" link="isa:60,1-14" lang="NIV" %}} which is {{% bible val="also written in other passages" link="isa:19,17-18" lang="NIV" %}}.

Israel’s calling is now fulfilled. It started with {{% bible val="Abraham to be a blessing to all nations" link="gen:12,2-3" lang="NIV" %}}, it went over to Israel where it started with the Exodus and it was finally fulfilled in Jesus who brought the nations to Israel (aka the Church). And {{% bible val="now the nations are coming" link="rev:21,24-27" lang="NIV" %}}. These nations are not all of the nations but only those who believe in Christ, because the {{% bible val="last verse includes unbelieving nations" link="rev:21,27" lang="NIV" %}}.

The {{% bible val="gates are not open to have exchange with the outside but to show the result of the action and show the security (there will be no night)" link="rev:21,25" lang="NIV" %}}.

While the faithful can come in, {{% bible val="the unfaithful can not" link="rev:21,27" lang="NIV" %}} which is also reflected in two {{% bible val="passages" link="isa:52,1" lang="NIV" %}} in {{% bible val="Isaiah" link="isa:35,8" lang="NIV" %}} where {{% bible val="shortly before pools of waters flow" link="isa:35,7" lang="NIV" %}}, and here in Revelation the water comes after this verse.

### {{% bible val="Symbols of Gods presence" link="rev:22,1-5" lang="NIV" %}}

<a name="38e5"></a>
This is based on

- the {{% bible val="river from the altar" link="ezk:47,1-9" lang="NIV" %}},
- the {{% bible val="river when Jerusalem is rebuild" link="zec:14,8" lang="NIV" %}} and
- the {{% bible val="water from the house of the Lord watering the trees" link="jol:3,18" lang="NIV" %}}

There is also a description in the {{% bible val="creation story where the rivers there related to precious stones" link="gen:2,10-12" lang="NIV" %}} as in {{% bible val="Revelation" link="rev:21,19-20" lang="NIV" %}}.

The source of all this is (the throne of) God and the Lamb. Water is often associated with the Holy Spirit

- {{% bible val="when God gives us a new heart" link="ezk:36,25-27" lang="NIV" %}},
- {{% bible val="born of water and Spirit" link="jhn:3,5" lang="NIV" %}}
- {{% bible val="living water and worship in the Spirit" link="jhn:4,10-24" lang="NIV" %}}
- {{% bible val="water and Spirit as witnesses" link="1jn:5,7-8" lang="NIV" %}}

Finally, the circle is closed to the beginning (of creation and fall): {{% bible val="The Tree of Life is back and everyone has access to it" link="rev:22,2" lang="NIV" %}}.

All the evil is gone and we can fully focus on serving God.

The {{% bible val="name on the forehead" link="rev:22,4" lang="NIV" %}} was {{% bible val="originally on the priests forehead" link="exo:28,36-38" lang="NIV" %}} and shows {{% bible val="that the character of God is imprinted on them and now us" link="1jn:3,2" lang="NIV" %}}.
