{{% bible val="Chapter 21" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation21" %}} and {{% bible val="22" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation22" %}}.

We have finally arrived at our destiny: The New Jerusalem. It is the place where we spend eternity. And this has some features that are very interesting:
- It is full of {{% bible val="precious elements" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation21%3A19-21" %}} (pearls as big as gate, precious stones, gold used even to plaster the streets) and a {{% bible val="river and the tree of life" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation22%3A1-2" %}} like in the {{% bible val="garden Eden" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Genesis2%3A9-14" %}}.
- It has elements of a {{% bible val="city" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation21%3A10-17" %}} (the place humans looked for {{% bible val="shelter" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Genesis4%3A16-17" %}} and {{% bible val="identity" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Genesis11%3A1-9" %}} after loosing their relationship to God)
- It is {{% bible val="personal" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation21%3A9-10" %}} as we are the bride.

These are all elements refering to the temple. But there will be {{% bible val="no temple" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation21%3A22" %}}, because the temple is based on distance (whoever you are you can come closer and closer to God - pagan, Jew, Levite, Priest, High Priest) and only the High Priest can go once a year in the real presence of God - the Holy of Holies.

But this is now ending as the New Jerusalem has the {{% bible val="shape of the Holy of Holies" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation21%3A16" %}}. But {{% bible val="directly outside this is what we would call hell" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation22%3A14-15" %}}. This describes the purpose of the New Jerusalem. It is about being in relationship with God: You are either all in or all out - the main message of the book.
