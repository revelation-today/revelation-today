{{% bible val="Chapter 21" link="rev:21" lang="NIV" %}} and {{% bible val="22" link="rev:22" lang="NIV" %}}.

We have finally arrived at our destiny: The New Jerusalem. It is the place where we spend eternity. And this has some features that are very interesting:
- It is full of {{% bible val="precious elements" link="rev:21,19-21" lang="NIV" %}} (pearls as big as gate, precious stones, gold used even to plaster the streets) and a {{% bible val="river and the tree of life" link="rev:22,1-2" lang="NIV" %}} like in the {{% bible val="garden Eden" link="gen:2,9-14" lang="NIV" %}}.
- It has elements of a {{% bible val="city" link="rev:21,10-17" lang="NIV" %}} (the place humans looked for {{% bible val="shelter" link="gen:4,16-17" lang="NIV" %}} and {{% bible val="identity" link="gen:11,1-9" lang="NIV" %}} after loosing their relationship to God)
- It is {{% bible val="personal" link="rev:21,9-10" lang="NIV" %}} as we are the bride.

These are all elements refering to the temple. But there will be {{% bible val="no temple" link="rev:21,22" lang="NIV" %}}, because the temple is based on distance (whoever you are you can come closer and closer to God - pagan, Jew, Levite, Priest, High Priest) and only the High Priest can go once a year in the real presence of God - the Holy of Holies.

But this is now ending as the New Jerusalem has the {{% bible val="shape of the Holy of Holies" link="rev:21,16" lang="NIV" %}}. But {{% bible val="directly outside this is what we would call hell" link="rev:22,14-15" lang="NIV" %}}. This describes the purpose of the New Jerusalem. It is about being in relationship with God: You are either all in or all out - the main message of the book.
