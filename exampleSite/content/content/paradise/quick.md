[Chapter 21](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation21) and [22](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation22).

We have finally arrived at our destiny: The New Jerusalem. It is the place where we spend eternity. And this has some features that are very interesting:
- It is full of [precious elements](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation21%3A19-21) (pearls as big as gate, precious stones, gold used even to plaster the streets) and a [river and the tree of life](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation22%3A1-2) like in the [garden Eden](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Genesis2%3A9-14).
- It has elements of a [city](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation21%3A10-17) (the place humans looked for [shelter](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Genesis4%3A16-17) and [identity](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Genesis11%3A1-9) after loosing their relationship to God)
- It is [personal](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation21%3A9-10) as we are the bride.

These are all elements refering to the temple. But there will be [no temple](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation21%3A22), because the temple is based on distance (whoever you are you can come closer and closer to God - pagan, Jew, Levite, Priest, High Priest) and only the High Priest can go once a year in the real presence of God - the Holy of Holies.

But this is now ending as the New Jerusalem has the [shape of the Holy of Holies](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation21%3A16). But [directly outside this is what we would call hell](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation22%3A14-15). This describes the purpose of the New Jerusalem. It is about being in relationship with God: You are either all in or all out - the main message of the book.
