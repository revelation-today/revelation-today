The 144,000 is a statement that many have heard. Who are they? And why are they counted? What is their purpose?

## The army of God

<a name="681a"></a>
This chapter jumps back in context and gives us a deeper look at the fifth seal. There the saints were portrayed as suffering and asking how long this will go on. At first glance, this gives the impression that the saints are suffering and want Jesus to end this because it is unbearable, but this chapter gives us a very deep insight into this.

The saints are not just enduring this, they are actively participating in God’s salvation. Let us take a closer look.

God marks His people — a sign of protection for the things to come. He then counts them. He counts them as an army. They are presented as an important force in God’s plan. This is what John hears, but what he sees is very different: These are the same people who come out of the Great Tribulation and praise God and live in God’s presence.

We had this before, before the opening of the seals: John hears of the (strong and violent) Lion of Judah, but he sees a lamb. Here it is the same thing: John hears about the army of the 144,000, but he sees an uncountable number of worshipers who are the ones coming out of the Great Tribulation. These are all the same people.

The Church must worship God and Him alone, or it will lose its foundation. Their victory will not come from power or miracles or wise words, but from how they endure in their tribulation. There are still many questions, but they will be answered, have patience.

Furthermore, this story tells us that being a Christian is NOT about getting saved and going to heaven. The book of Revelation does not tell us how to get around all the tribulations. We are sealed, we are not to worry about them, we will not lose our salvation if things go wrong or if we doubt or make mistakes.

We are described as an army — soldiers who always worry if they might get hurt or die are not fit for battle. We are soldiers in God’s army, but not an army of violence, but of worship and endurance, and we win when we stop looking at our own salvation, but at God’s plan.

### Reflection

<a name="8e53"></a>
- In this chapter, worship is related to warfare? What does that mean?
- What weapons do you use to fight for this world?
- Are you fighting for this world or are you waiting (maybe telling some people about Jesus) and waiting for your salvation?
- Do you care about environmental destruction, global exploitation, human trafficking, and so many others, or do you just wait for Jesus to come back (hopefully soon) and fix it? Or, on the contrary, do you think it is good that things are getting worse because then Jesus will come sooner?
- How does it make you feel to be part of God’s army?
- Being counted means that you will not get lost. What does that mean to you?
- God’s army comes from the Great Tribulation. What will happen to your faith when you are tested? Will it grow stronger or will it crumble? Do you believe that God can strengthen your faith when it is tested? What is your faith based on?
