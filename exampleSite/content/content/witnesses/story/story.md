This is the time when we see the material and spiritual world as they really are. First of all: The temple of Gods presence is not a place where we have to gain favor to please God but the place where we show our heart by loving loyal and faithful for him in this world.

The church does not look convincing now. Being witnesses to the world with authority but constantly in defense and finally destroyed. And the whole world celebrates. How can this be?

Because this is not the end. In their deepest and weakest moment the church was victorious. The people needed to see that in times of suffering there is a convincing hope that you can hang on. This is only possible if the church is ready to walk as a witness in difficult times and with this resembles Jesus perfectly: despite authority on the run, finally conquered, resurrected and lifted up.

But can the church we weak when the devil is around. Lets have a look at his achievements:

- He wanted to destroy Jesus — and failed
- Therefore he needed to defend his place in heaven — and was cast out
- He tried to destroy Israel — and failed again
- Finally he persecute the church and imitates God — and becomes a laughing stock

The task is not to defeat the devil — this was done by Jesus — but to draw the people into a relationship with God
