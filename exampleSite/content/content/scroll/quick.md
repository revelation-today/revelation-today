[Chapter 10](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation10)

After the unsuccessful attempt to draw the people to God by prayer it needs a new mystery to be revealed. This time it is the mystery of God.

The whole scene starts with an angel that appears like [Jesus](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation1%3A13-16) from his description from the [prophet Daniel as the son of man](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation1%3A7). And he has a little scroll in his hand. This links this to the story with the other reference to the scroll which [Jesus was worthy to open](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation5%3A1-7).

John needs to eat (internalise) this scroll which is sweet (its the gospel), but also bitter -  we will see especially in the next chapter. This scroll reveals the mystery of God: It is to be like Jesus. What this means is revealed in the next chapters. 

But before we go in there we are reminded that God is [in full control over whatever we are facing](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation10%3A5): As we see the beasts comes form earth and sea and putting a foot down means to have control over something.
