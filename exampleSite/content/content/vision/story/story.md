But you might ask yourself if there is not more to the story than: Jesus died for my sins and be accepting this and telling others about it from time to time (giving testimony). Well, there is. It is much more and I don’t know if you like it. Because we are kings and queens and have a responsibility for this world. The clock is ticking and there is an important task at hand. The salvation of the whole world. And it’s not about me but the church and its mystery.

The church should be the light of the world and living out of the strength of Jesus. This is not more and not less as Jesus thinks of the church. But is the church keeping up to this?
