{{% bible val="Chapter 1" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation1" %}}.

The time has arrived. The prophecy of Daniel is fulfilled and the church rules the world! What fantastic news. But the church needs to act now.

The is to much at stake. The salvation of all the nations depends on how the church acts: Will they reject Jesus when he comes back or embrace him?

God has a vision of the church. If the church lives in this vision she will be successful.

Of course Jesus is in the middle of the vision and the church is represented as lambstands and stars. The message is duplicated and simple:
- The church should be a light in the world like the lambstands (as only light in the temple) and the stars
- but in strong dependency on Jesus (stars in hand, lambstand need oil - Holy Spirit)

This is what Jesus the church compares against. What will he find?
