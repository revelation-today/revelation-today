The devil with all his minions takes up quite a bit of space in the book of Revelation, and I also spend quite a few articles on the subject. Why is this? Shouldn’t we spend more time and effort describing God? Well, there is a reason.

## The character of the devil

<a name="537c"></a>
The devil is described as aggressive, which is hard to deal with as a believer, but you know what you are dealing with. But he is also a deceiver and that is even more dangerous because you may be tired of all the fighting and think there is an easy way out. But the result is that you become loyal to the devil without even fully understanding it. That is why the book describes God and Satan so that you can see the differences and the similarities.

## The description of the devil

<a name="4281"></a>
The devil appears always in the form of a trinity, since God is three.

The first time this is {{% bible val="after the enthronement of Christ" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation5" %}} (he is worthy to open the scroll) {{% bible val="as four horsemen" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation6%3A1-8" %}} (the fourth is a summary of the other three). His action is described in very briefly (8 verses) and is in contrast to the two chapters of the eternal worship of God.

The first horseman appears as the great victor, but only 7 verses later he leaves a place of total destruction: The devil cannot fulfill his promises.

The second time he appears is when {{% bible val="Jesus declared victorious again" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation12" %}}, born of the woman. Satan is shown as the ultimate loser.

- {{% bible val="He tries to destroy the child – and fail" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation12%3A1-6" %}}s.
- {{% bible val="He fights against Michael – and is cast out of heaven" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation12%3A7-12" %}}.
- {{% bible val="He tries to destroy the woman – and fails" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation12%3A13-17" %}}.
- {{% bible val="He tries to destroy the descendants of Jesus, the Church, and also fails" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13" %}} as we see in [the number 666](/content/beasts/expl/666-the-number-of-the-beast#5112).

The devil is shown again {{% bible val="as a trinity in the sixth bowl" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation16%3A13" %}}. which is judged in chapters {{% bible val="19" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation19%3A20" %}} and {{% bible val="20" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation20%3A10" %}}. These passages frame the story of the harlot, where we also have one beast and the harlot.

These three views are interrelated in describing the devil’s activity.

## The false trinity

<a name="45d1"></a>
To better understand how the devil is described, we need to look at the {{% bible val="second story of the dragon and the two beasts" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13" %}}.

He sets [up an evil trinity](/content/beasts/expl/the-nature-of-the-beast-in-the-book-of-revelation#f4be) to deceive the church, but [to no avail](/content/beasts/expl/666-the-number-of-the-beast#5112).

The [dragon and the beasts are described as working together to accomplish their goal](/content/beasts/expl/the-nature-of-the-beast-in-the-book-of-revelation#f4be) but they acted differently. The first beast used violence, while the second used signs and miracles and economic pressure, [see also in the historical context](/content/beasts/expl/the-beasts-and-the-666-in-historical-context).

Now, if we look now [at the three horseman, we see the same pattern](/content/seals/expl/the-mystery-of-the-four-horse-men):

- First comes the deceiver,
- followed by the one who uses violence (brings war),
- followed by the one who brings economic injustice.

The fourth is a summary of all of them, see we have another trinity situation there.

Finally, we look at the story of the harlot. Despite the many players in chapter 17, it is hard to see a trinity there. But you will make two observations:

There is a strong parallel between the beast in chapter 17 and the first beast in chapter 13.

| The first beast of Revelation 13 | The beast on Revelation 17 |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| {{% bible val="Has 7 heads and 10 horns" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C1" %}} | {{% bible val="Has 7 heads and 10 horns" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C3" %}} |
| {{% bible val="Head as if slaughtered, grows back" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C3" %}} | {{% bible val="5 kings fallen, the seventh yet to come" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C10" %}} |

| {{% bible val="All who are not written in the book of life worship the beast" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C8" %}} | {{% bible val="All who are not written in the book of life are overwhelmed" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C8" %}} |

But there is also a strong connection between the Second Beast in chapter 13 and the Harlot

## The Harlot and the Second Beast

| The Second Beast of Revelation 13 | The Harlot |
|-----------------------------------|------------|
| {{% bible val="Comes from Earth" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C11" %}} | {{% bible val="Sits in desert" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C3" %}} |
| {{% bible val="Has two horns like a lamb" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C11" %}} | {{% bible val="Is dressed like the bride of the lamb" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C4" %}} |
| {{% bible val="Acts in power of the (first) beast" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C12" %}} | {{% bible val="Sits on the (first) beast" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C3" %}} |
| {{% bible val="Can make fire fall from the sky" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C13" %}} | {{% bible val="Will be directed by fire " link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C16" %}} ({{% bible val="Offb.18/9" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation18%2C9" %}}) |
| {{% bible val="All who do not worship it will be killed" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C15" %}} | {{% bible val="Drink blood of the saints" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C6" %}} |
| {{% bible val="Make a sign on forehead and hand" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C16" %}} | {{% bible val="Has sign on forehead: Babel" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C5" %}} |
| {{% bible val="Cannot buy or sell without characters" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C17" %}} | {{% bible val="Cannot buy or sell without sign" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation18%2C3" %}} ({{% bible val="Offb.18/11-17" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation18%2C11-17" %}}) |
| {{% bible val="Requires wisdom" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13%2C18" %}} | {{% bible val="Requires wisdom" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%2C9" %}} |

The power of the harlot is also reversed here into: while in chapter 13 she dropped fire from heaven, now she is destroyed by fire; while she makes a mark on her forehead, here she herself is branded on the forehead (like a slave).

So where is the third part? Well he stays in the background as in chapter 13 and does nothing as in the description of the horsemen. But you will see him it {{% bible val="the sixth bowl" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation16%3A13" %}} and in chapter {{% bible val="20" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation20%3A10" %}}.

[This was also the case in the historical context](/content/beasts/expl/the-beasts-and-the-666-in-historical-context): You see the two beasts but you do not see the devil directly.

## The development of the picture

<a name="6ef8"></a>
Looking at the development of the image, we see Satan in the first horsemen. This scene comes right after Jesus is identified as the one worthy to open the scroll [that brings salvation to the world](/content/seals/expl/the-book-with-the-seven-seals). Satan is exposed right after that. For this is what he claims in the first horsemen.

He is the one who is victorious, but he ends up in destruction and death everywhere. He was exposed for bringing the opposite of what Jesus brings. But what is that?

This is the theme that is developed in the story of the dragon and the two beasts. There [are some appealing things that Satan seems to be offering](/content/beasts/expl/the-nature-of-the-beast-in-the-book-of-revelation#896a). But he clearly shows the alternative: [The two witnesses who live a lifestyle of worship and are faithful in their testimony even unto death.](/content/witnesses/expl/the-two-witnesses)

This is finally unfolded in the last view, where Babel is described in detail as the counterpart of the New Jerusalem.
