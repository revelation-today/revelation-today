What are the weapons that the Church uses in the battle against the unbelieving world and the dragon and the beast? What is the eternal gospel?

## Our text

<a name="9cd8"></a>
We are moving quickly forward and reached [chapter 14](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation14).

## God’s army

<a name="7173"></a>
From the previous chapter, it would seem that the church does not have a stand against the devil and his actions. But we saw with the two witnesses and the story of Jesus that this is not the case.

While Satan is doing his thing, the church, or should I say God’s army, is not standing idly by. But what are they doing?

The answer is simple:

- They sing the song of Moses, which leads them to focus on their true purpose: the salvation of the nations.
- The mystery of God led them to be like Jesus and to conquer with love and not with fear.
- They put aside their challenges and focus on Jesus and concentrate on being faithful to Him no matter the cost (this is what it means to be in an army: focus on the one thing that matters).

## The destiny of the nations

<a name="8213"></a>
Having looked at God’s army, we will see the impact. Seven angels will come and proclaim or act:

- The first comes and speaks an invitation to the nations to worship God.
- The second comes and speaks judgment on Babel for trying to deceive the nations (Babel has a strong connection to the second beast).
- The third gives a clear warning to the nations not to give their allegiance to Satan.
- The fourth looks like Jesus announcing a harvest, while the fifth performs it — this is the gathering of the nations that have accepted Christ.
- The sixth announces the harvest that the seventh angel does — this is the judgment on the nation that has rejected Christ.

The whole chapter is about the nation and the church’s efforts to bring the nations to Jesus. It is up to the nations to respond, some will and some will not. It is not up to the Church to make the nations believe, but to be a witness. But we will see more about this in the next chapter.

### Reflection

<a name="a5ea"></a>
- The key to God’s army is being faithful to Jesus. When do you think that is not enough and why?
- What does it mean to always be faithful to Jesus?
- What would be the song of Moses and Jesus that you would sing in your life?
- Do you know that not all nations are saved? What does that mean to you?
