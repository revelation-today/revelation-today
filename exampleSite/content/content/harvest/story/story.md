{{% bible val="Chapter 14–16" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation14" %}}

<a name="37a3"></a>
Jesus victory at the cross and the testimony of the church did it all and the enemy is scattered around. The faithful sing in victory — their only skill required was loyalty to God.

But for the ones that played along with the devil to avoid consequence: You will face no easier consequence now.

It is time to check. The two harvests reveal there the hard reality. Some will be saved others get lost.

And this is the time to Gods zeal steps in. His actions will shake and shake again against false loyalty, attacking his people, hardening of the hearts and the deception of the devil until this kingdom totally collapses.
