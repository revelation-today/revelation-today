{{% bible val="Chapter 14" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation14" %}}).

After the impressive presentation of the dragon and the two beasts one thing is clear. The victors are the saints. And their main strenght is ther loyalty to God (being virgins). The standing at the sea of glass as a reminder that God is souvereign over all evil and sing the victory song.

Now comes the repercussion for the followers of the beast. But before this comes an angels and announces that the gospel is for everybody on this earth.

The next two angels declare judgment over the followers of the beast. 

The remaining four angels are describing two harvests.

The 
- first harvest is a collection of the faithful
    - a figure resembling the son of man (Jesus) is leading this
    - there is only a collection not processing of the harvest
- while the second one is the judgment of the unfaithful
    - here also the harvest if processed (grapes are trampled)
    - their blood will flow (Jesus blood is not covering them)

And here the circle closes to the first angel. How did the nations respond? Did they take the gospel to heart.

Because this was the content of the [little scroll](/content/scroll/quick): The church must act like Jesus (mystery of God), so that all nations are saved.
