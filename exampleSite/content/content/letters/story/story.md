[Chapter 2–3](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation2)

<a name="83ff"></a>
Look at the churches now. We start with Ephesus the hard working church. They work, endure and keep the teaching clean, but the main thing is missing: The love, the reason why they exists. This church has no purpose and could also disappear.

But very different is the next one: Smyrna. A small town, overwhelmed by an ungodly society, the church in persecution and hated by the Jews. This is not a church you might want to be in, but one of the the only two that get high praises from Jesus.

Also Pergamon is under high pressure with the throne of Satan himself is in there. They through a lot — even martyrdom — but they allow wrong teaching that leads the people away from God.

In Thyatira the things are even worse: The cause of trouble is the leadership itself.

Sardes is not much better as here the people think they can manage it all without God help and nearly completely fail.

But Philadelphia is without blame. However, not the church you want to join, because on top of all the other problems this church is financially exhausted including their members.

Which leaves us with Laodicea which is the only one that does now receive any kind of praise from Jesus even the church is very impressed by itself.

But Jesus does not give up on them, he gives individual advice, warnings and promises.
