What does a dead church look like? How do you give new life in there? Curious? Check out the [letter to Sardis](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation3%3A1-6).


## The historical background

<a name="bf90"></a>
Sardis has definitely the longest history of all. The city is perfectly situated in terms of climate (on the edge of a mountain range and a fertile valley).

It was almost impregnable because it was 500 meters above the sea level, not connected to the mountains and surrounded by rocks. Because of this, the city overestimated itself and was conquered twice in places that were considered impregnable.

The city was always of great importance, e.g. when it was destroyed by a massive earthquake in 17 B.C., it was rebuilt under the leadership of the Emperor Tiberius, and nine years later it applied for the construction of a temple in honor of the Emperor.


## Jesus’s view

<a name="87a6"></a>
Jesus [approached the church in the fullness of the Spirit and reminded them of their call to be light to the world](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation3%3A1).

There is little praise (only a few who are blameless).

But much more rebuke: The church is dead, its works are not complete, and it must act quickly. What is the problem?


## The problem

<a name="8872"></a>
The main problem is their false self-image. The overestimation of the city rubbed off on them.

The basic problem was that they thought they could be a church without the Holy Spirit.

The reference [to being dead and awakening what is about to die](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation3%3A1-2) has a strong connection to the [vision of the dead bones, where the Holy Spirit comes and breathes in new life](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Ezekiel37).

Also the reference to “[found your deeds incomplete in the sight of God](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation3%3A2)” is a reminder that “[all complete work comes from God, the Father of lights](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/James1%3A17)”.

They should act quickly or God will take them by surprise, for life without the Holy Spirit is not sustainable.


## The promise

<a name="a7e5"></a>
The white robes are a sign of acquittal in court.

The fact that names are not blotted out of the Book of Life means that they do not lose their citizenship in heaven. But only those who repent. This is a wake-up call! Intended to shock.
