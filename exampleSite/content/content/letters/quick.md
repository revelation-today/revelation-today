The letters describe how the churches live in the vision. This shows the view that Jesus has on the churches. And the result is devastating:
- only two church onyl receive praise: Smyrna and Philadelpia which suffer under persecution and poverty
- two churches are completely failing, while of them dont get any praise at all: Ephesus and Laodicea
- another church gets only praise due to a few members of the church: Sardis
- another one he wants to set as an example of judgment for the others: Thyatira
- the one church missing is hit hard by wrong teaching leading them to idolatry: Pergamon

This is even illustrated in a symmetric pattern:
- Ephesus - total failure: no love
    - Smyrna - great example: but in persecution
        - Pergamon - big problem: wrong teaching allowed
            - Thyatira - sets as warning example: leadership is the problem
        - Sardis - big problem: missing Holy Spirit
    - Philadelpha - great example: but in poverty
- Laodicea - total faiture: nothing good so say
