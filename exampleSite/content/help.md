Let me give you an idea how the page works and how you navigate.
- You get back to the **homepage** by clicking on the left top part of the page
- You can give me **feedback** by clicking on "Contact" in the menu (on the top of the page for widescreen or in the menu for small screen like smartphones).
- You can **open the menu** on a small screen by pressing the "=" on the top right of the page.
- You can change into **dark mode** (energy saving) by pressing on the moon symbol on the bottom of the page.

You have also a **search menu** where you can search your topic - for widescreen on the top right, on a small screen on top of the menu.

Bible verses are written in purple and show you the bible verse. Have a look at this {{% bible val="example" link="rev:12,1-6" lang="en" %}}.

The website is organized in tours that lead you systematically around, but on each topic you can switch between them. In the menu you will see all the topics contained in this tour. If you are interested in the dragon and the two beasts you can start a {{% int_link val="tour" link="/welcome" %}} (e.g. {{% int_link val="application" link="/welcome/appl" %}}) and navigate directly to this part.

You can also have a look at the {{% int_link val="used bible verses" link="/expl/bible_ref/poetry/psa" %}}.
