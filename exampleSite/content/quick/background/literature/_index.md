One of the first questions to ask about the book is 
- What is the essential message of the book? 
- Is this a prediction of the future and if so, when does it begin? 
- Is it literal or symbolic? 
- Is there a common thread in the book?

We'll look at all of these questions, but let's start with the question: Is this literal or symbolic?

This is an important question because, after all, we want to take God's word seriously and not simply understand things symbolically that are meant literally. I am firmly convinced that Jesus really did rise again, that the miracles in the Bible are real and much more.

But is this the case everywhere? What do you mean by these examples: 
- Should we only {{% bible val="forgive 7 times 70, that is 490 times" link="mat:18:21-25" lang="en" %}}? 
- Are we {{% bible val="sheep that eat grass" link="psa:23:2" lang="en" %}}?
- Shall we {{% bible val="pluck out our eyes if they cause us to sin" link="mat:18:9" lang="en" %}}? 
- Will {{% bible val="a beast with many heads and horns roam the world" link="rev:13:1-2" lang="en" %}}?

I suspect you have found one or two examples where you assume a symbolic interpretation. If you see everything literally, that would interest me.

But if some things are symbolic and others are literal, then it's important to have clear guidelines and that's what this book is about.

The first aspect we look at is the type of book. Are we reading a report, a parable or a prophetic vision and what does that tell us about the book? The answer to this is a little more complicated: 
- It is a {{% int_link val="Letter" link="/expl/background/literature/the-book-of-revelation-how-to-read-it/#letter" %}} (to 7 churches in parallel) -> So the whole book had to be relevant and understandable for the people at that time 
- It is a {{% int_link val="Prophecy" link="/expl/background/literature/the-book-of-revelation-how-to-read-it/#prophecy" %}} -> It uses figurative language and is not a prediction of the future 
- It is an {{% int_link val="Apocalypse" link="/expl/background/literature/the-book-of-revelation-how-to-read-it/#apocalypse" %}} -> It deliberately exaggerates to provoke a decision.

This {{% int_link val="is an indication" link="/expl/background/literature/the-book-of-revelation-how-to-read-it/#summary" %}} that this book contains a lot of symbolic content.

The {{% int_link val="use of the words 'show' and 'make known'" link="/expl/background/literature/literally-or-symbolic/#deiknumi" %}}, which are used by the author at the beginning of the book, also suggest a symbolic meaning.

So, putting this all together we can say that the book is revealing what is behind the curtains of the reality we perceive every day like in this [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z9hMartaFc&pp=ygURdGhleSBsaXZlIHRyYWlsZXI%3D) (dont watch the movie).
