{{% bible val="Chapter 1" link="rev:1" lang="en" %}}.

The time has arrived. The prophecy of Daniel is fulfilled and the church rules the world! What fantastic news. This is how the book starts.

But the church needs to act now as kings and priests as we are prepared.

The is to much at stake. The salvation of all the nations depends on how the church acts: Will they reject Jesus when he comes back or embrace him? 
People mourn about the pierced one because
- they love him and look forward to see him against
- they had no love for him and fear his coming back

God has a vision of the church. If the church lives in this vision she will be successful and there will be so much more people that look with hope in the future when Jesus comes back.

Of course Jesus is in the middle of the vision and the church is represented as lambstands and stars. The message is duplicated and simple:
- The church should be a light in the world like the lambstands (as only light in the temple) and the stars
- but in strong dependency on Jesus (stars in hand, lambstand needs oil - Holy Spirit)

The angels of the churches are a description of the church with the reminder that they are messengers of God.

This is what Jesus the church compares against. What will he find?
