{{% bible val="Chapter 8" link="rev:8" lang="en" %}} and {{% bible val="9" link="rev:9" lang="en" %}}.

## The prayer

The chapter starts with the last seal and introduces the trumpets. After the last seal is a time of silence in heaven. 
In jewish literature this typically the time when God listens to the prayers of the saints.

And this is what follows. But there is an important element to consider: The angels preparing themselves to blow the trumpet but they wait: 
They are waiting for the prayers to be presented to God.

What a statement: The prayers cause the trumpets as well as Jesus death on the cross caused the seals and the passion of God the bowls. 
What a statement about the importance of prayer.

## The trumpets

The trumpets do mainly one thing: The strip away all securities that people have
- water
- food
- orientation
- trade/economy

But it continues, now cause by demonic being: 
- health and hope
- life itself

But after all that happens the people still do not change their hearts. They are clinging to the even same demons that took away their hope, well being and even life. 
This seems to be a dead end. The people are even more closed up now. The solution is the next chapter where the mystery of God is revealed. 
But before lets have a look at the church.

She is protected ({{% bible val="by the seal" link="rev:7,1-4" lang="en" %}}) from the {{% bible val="fifth trumpet" link="rev:9,4-6" lang="en" %}} - 
they will not loose hope while endurung all the trouble and even loosing their live. 
But enduring all the loss of the same securites and even their lives make this a great testimony to let people see what are real securities.
