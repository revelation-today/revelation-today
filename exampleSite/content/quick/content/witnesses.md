{{% bible val="Chapter 11" link="rev:11" lang="en" %}}.

The mystery of God will be revealed in this chapter. 

The chapter consists of three parts
- the temple
- the two witnesses
- the aftermath and revelation of Gods presence

and this is all covered (the next three chapters) but a strange timeslot which is identical and describes the time from Jesus first coming to his second coming: 1260 days = 42 months = 3,5 times (years). This is the time when God completes his plan according to {{% bible val="Daniel" link="dan:9,24-27" lang="en" %}} and a time of the question who is the real God (based on {{% bible val="Elija" link="1ki:19" lang="en" %}}.

## The temple

The scenary starts with the temple which is no longer used for sacrifices, but it is the place of worship. Everything else is released for destruction. As the temple is the presence of God it means that the presence of God is defined by worship which means devotion and loyalty to him alone.

## The witnesses

This is what the witnesses do. They fully devote them selves to the life of Christ. They come in sack clothes, they perform signs and miracles, but the important point comes, when they are at their weakest point.

The are defeated, killed and exposed for humiliation. But as well as Christ they are raised to live and raised to heaven. 

This is not a description of a literal behaviour but shows how far they go in the loyalty to Christ.

And than the miracle happens: A big judgment comes but 90%(!!!) fo the people are saved. What an overwhelming success.
