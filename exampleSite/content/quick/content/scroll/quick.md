{{% bible val="Chapter 10" link="rev:10" lang="en" %}}

After the unsuccessful attempt to draw the people to God by prayer it needs a new mystery to be revealed. This time it is the mystery of God.

The whole scene starts with an angel that appears like {{% bible val="Jesus" link="rev:1,13-16" lang="en" %}} from his description from the {{% bible val="prophet Daniel as the son of man" link="rev:1,7" lang="en" %}}. And he has a little scroll in his hand. This links this to the story with the other reference to the scroll which {{% bible val="Jesus was worthy to open" link="rev:5,1-7" lang="en" %}}.

John needs to eat (internalise) this scroll which is sweet (its the gospel), but also bitter -  we will see especially in the next chapter. This scroll reveals the mystery of God: It is to be like Jesus. What this means is revealed in the next chapters. 

But before we go in there we are reminded that God is {{% bible val="in full control over whatever we are facing" link="rev:10,5" lang="en" %}}: As we see the beasts comes form earth and sea and putting a foot down means to have control over something.
