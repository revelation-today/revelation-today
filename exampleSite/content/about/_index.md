Hi, I'm Hagen.

Since I was 14 (more than 30 years ago) I was fascinated by the Book of Revelation in the Bible. It was hard to understand at first, but I understood more and more and good deeper understanding of the book.

I started with some basics but learned more and more by reading some theological books (not the smallest one) and I was excited how relevant this book is about todays time.

And I am not talking about guessing who is the Antichrist or what happens when Jesus comes back, but how we can life an effective discipleship.

And I want to share what I learned without you reading through all the books. I set up this page as a type of wiki so you can have some guidance and walk systematically but also have the freedom to focus on whatever is important for you.

It is on my heart to be open what God really wants to say in this book, but I might be wrong in some aspects - so I am contineously learning and update this webpage when I (still) learn something new. So, I don't claim to have all the answers and that my understanding is the best and one and only. But I think this goes in the right direction and I share the reason why I think so to be transparent.

### Help from

I did not do this alone. First there was a great amount of book from {{% int_link val="great theologians" link="/about/ressources" %}} that gave me a great understanding.

But then there are toolchains like 
- [hekstra](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hextra/) as website framework
- [deepl](https://deepl.com) for translating content

And massive feedback from friends who patiently reviewed and reviewing.

### Principles of the interpretation

I try to make these articles not abstract but applicable to daily life, not as a list of instructions but more like awareness and guiding questions. Sorry, life is not that easy and you need the guidance of the Holy Spirit ;-)

I donâ€™t claim to present the one and only truth about Revelation. This is the view that I have developed over several decades and I am still learning. So please feel free to challenge my arguments. If you have a good point, I will be happy to adjust the articles.

In my argumentation I try to be as transparent as possible and will not use power arguments (great and famous preacher x said so, so it must be true), but go with the following priorities

- What the Bible says to understand a passage
- Literature background: Read a letter differently than a prophetic book
- Historical background to better understand the daily life of the people
- References to Jewish or non-biblical Christian literature
