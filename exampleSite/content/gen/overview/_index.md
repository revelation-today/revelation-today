title: "The main topics"
---

Let’s start simple. Maybe you have never read the book and have only heard about it. This is the perfect place for you to start. I will introduce you to some of the main concepts and this may give you a good understanding to read the book on your own.

## What’s the story?

<a name="e0bf"></a>
The Book of Revelation is poetry. Its main purpose is not to inform but to move us to action. The promise of the book is for those who listen and live accordingly.

The book is partly a parody:

- It mocks the Roman Empire (and all other empires, societies, philosophies, …) and their claims to bring paradise on earth, but exposes their failures and weaknesses, so that we hold on to God.
- It challenges religious beliefs (that a strong savior is coming who, together with a strong church, will conquer evil in a military way). The victory comes in what seems to be weak, but conquers the world.
- It exaggerates because it wants a reaction from the readers.

The story is not about God unleashing many catastrophes to punish the world, but about God and the Church taking action to save people. OK, this sounds a bit extreme, but I hope it will become clearer as we go deeper into the subject.

There are actually four parts to the story:

- Ch.1: God’s expectation of the church: to be light to the world, but dependent on him
- Ch.2–3: The situation and the struggles of the church
- Ch.4–20: How God intends to overcome this situation
- Ch.21–22: What is the goal we are aiming for

Well the third part is a bit longer, so lets have a look at this structure

- Ch.4: The throne of God and the worship — The base of all actions
- Ch.5–7: The seals: What did Jesus death on the cross cause?
- Ch.8–14: The trumpets and its aftermath: What do our prayers cause?
- Ch.15–20: The bowls of wrath: Gods final actions

The question is: How is God going to fulfill his plan of salvation, and what is the role of the church in that?

## The main players

<a name="1b32"></a>
The book speaks about roughly four main players

- God including Jesus and the Holy Spirit (the good in the spiritual)
- Saints trusting and following God (the good in the “natural”)
- Devil and his demons (the bad in the spiritual)
- People that are following the devil (the bad in the “natural”)

Just as the spiritual world is divided, and so is the “natural” world, so the intention is for all people to join the good side (in the “natural” world).

The book of Revelation knows only these four categories and works with opposites (lamb and dragon, Babel and Jerusalem, angels and demons, …) and leaves no room for gray areas — either your king is Jesus or your king is the emperor in Rome, you worship Jesus or you worship the devil.

## The challenge

<a name="99f1"></a>
Looking at the world and its problems today, it seems impossible to find a solution for a better world. Evil governments, ruthless global corporations, and human greed and complacency seem unbeatable.

Everyone knows the problems, but there seems to be nothing anyone can do. And when someone could do something significant, they are often unwilling to do it. And the church seems to offer no solution.

It was no different 2000 years ago. There was the Roman Empire, which claimed to bring paradise on earth, but there was something wrong with it. The Jews, who are actually the origin of the saints, were great opponents of them. So what could the church (referred to as the saints) do?

Well, the answer is simple: The problem is the church because it is not living up to its vision. But Revelation wants to change that: Make the church what it should be, to overcome evil and save people.

## Jesus and the church

<a name="9799"></a>
If you ask who is the hero of the book, it is clear: Jesus. Right at the beginning it says: “The Revelation of Jesus Christ. That is the title, and it runs through the whole book.

- He evaluates the churches,
- He is worshiped with the Father
- He is worthy to open the seals.
- His story marks the center of the book
- He will fight the harlot and marry the bride
- He will come and judge the earth.

And he is the one the devil is trying to copy.

You get more and more glimpses of Jesus, sometimes directly and sometimes through his opposite: how the devil acts to copy him.

The two witnesses in [chapter 11](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation11) follow in Jesus’ footsteps from their calling to their death, resurrection, and ascension. And the turning point was not when they performed signs and wonders, but when they gave their lives (and God confirmed them) and many unbelievers worshiped God.

The church can only be successful if it follows Jesus without compromise.

On the other hand you see the devil in [chapter 13](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13)setting up a counter-trinity that has all the things we think are needed in the church.

- everyone is amazed
- all enemies are conquered
- all worship
- signs and wonders
- the whole world submits

But that is just the outside. But a closer look shows that this is not Jesus and not what the church should be at all. Do you see why?

## The messianic war

<a name="6277"></a>
When you think of the “end times,” when Jesus returns, you think of catastrophes and devastating wars with a lot of people dying. This is what the Jews thought at the time of Jesus, which is written down in their apocalyptic literature: An end game with a strong savior who brings violence.

Even though the book has apocalyptic elements, it challenges that idea.

- Jesus appears as the one who was [pierced](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation1%3A7) just before being introduced [as the Son of Man who will judge the world](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation1%3A12-16).
- The throne room of God mentions elements of grace like the [rainbow](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation4%3A3).
- The Lion of Judah is actually the [Lamb](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation5%3A5-6) of God
- The [army of the 144.000](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation7%3A4-8) is explained as people who [worship](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation7%3A9-10) God and later as those who follow the lamb and the [faithful](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation14%3A1-5) who come out of the Great Tribulation.
- The victory of the two witnesses is their [death](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation11%3A7-13).
- The mysterious place of [Armageddon](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation16%3A14) describes the [defeat of the strong and the victory of the absolute weak](../../../../content/bowls/expl/the-key-to-armageddon).
- The harlot is [destroyed by the beast](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A16) on which she [sat](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A3).
- Jesus comes and [kills the armies with the sword of his mouth](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation19%3A21).

This means that the “apocalyptic events” are probably very different than we think. The wording of other passages also casts doubt on war and disaster being the main theme of the book.

The main themes of the book are worship, true witness, and perseverance. They are talking about everyday life.

## The Antichrist

<a name="dd7a"></a>
Now, if you read carefully, you will see that this word does not appear in the book, but in the [epistle of John](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/1%20John2%3A18) (and there he talks about many of them in his day). But the principle is shown in the book. Anti can mean not only “against,” but also “instead. And there are many places where he tries to be instead of Jesus.

He appears [in the first seal as a savior](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation6%3A1-2), the imitates the [Trinity of God](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation13) and the harlot is a [perverted image of the Bride of Christ](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17%3A1-6).

These chapters are more about the pitfalls of the church and what is not essential:

- Miracles are good, but people should not be amazed at our power, because the deciding factor is our love for people.
- It is important to convince people, but it is wrong to manipulate or work with fear.
- Although the beast seems to control the world, it is the saints who do it.
- There are two different words used for conquering, one for the beast and one for the Church, which show different ways.

## The weapons of the saints

<a name="1077"></a>
If you think the defining element of the church is miracles, power over evil, and political/financial influence, you can easily be misled. Chapter 13 shows that the devil also has these things. In fact, the two witnesses have them as well, but they do not bring about change, only the wrath of others against them. Because it often comes with intimidation, fear, and manipulation, as we have seen in the Crusades, the Inquisition, and abusive relationships in the church even in our own day.

The weapons are very different and have a different purpose than the beast. It is not the destruction of the enemy, but his conversion.

- Worship: Actually, this is the main theme of this book. Worship is the answer to the failures of the seven churches, it is the main activity of the 144,000, it is the goal of the whole world-to finally worship God. This also has to do with faithfulness. Whatever happens, stay with God and follow His way.
- Testimony: If you read it with awareness, you will see that it is everywhere. It is about living and imitating Christ to the point of death. That was the thing that turned the situation around in chapter 11. Satan was defeated by the blood of Jesus and the [testimony](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation12%3A11) in chapter 12. Read it for yourself and see how many times you find testimony or witness and in what situations.
- Prayer: It is not mentioned often, in fact only once, but in a central part: It set the trumpets in motion.
- Conquering and enduring: The saints take time to conquer and often have to persevere. They don’t push or force things, but they persevere.

## Conclusion

<a name="5eda"></a>
There are many thoughts about what can be done to make this world a better place. But this book actually gives a concrete hope and guideline even in today’s world how to move forward.

But is this book not about listing disasters and God’s wrath coming down on earth? Well, there are a lot of pictures used to spur people into action. This is a book designed to provoke.
