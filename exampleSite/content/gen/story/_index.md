You might be a believer for long and you know the answers on the important questions: What need to be done to be saved, how to live a blessed and successful life and how to get to heaven.

You have found your place in the world and know how to manoeuvre. There might be open questions and some challenges in life but all together you managing. Life may not be perfect but all will be good when we are in heaven. And here comes the discovery of the {{% bible val="book of Revelation" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation1" %}}.

### New beginnings ({{% bible val="Chapter 1" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation1" %}})

<a name="55d5"></a>
But you might ask yourself if there is not more to the story than: Jesus died for my sins and be accepting this and telling others about it from time to time (giving testimony). Well, there is. It is much more and I don’t know if you like it. Because we are kings and queens and have a responsibility for this world. The clock is ticking and there is an important task at hand. The salvation of the whole world. And it’s not about me but the church and its mystery.

The church should be the light of the world and living out of the strength of Jesus. This is not more and not less as Jesus thinks of the church. But is the church keeping up to this?

### A grand disaster ({{% bible val="Chapter 2–3" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation2" %}})

<a name="83ff"></a>
Look at the churches now. We start with Ephesus the hard working church. They work, endure and keep the teaching clean, but the main thing is missing: The love, the reason why they exists. This church has no purpose and could also disappear.

But very different is the next one: Smyrna. A small town, overwhelmed by an ungodly society, the church in persecution and hated by the Jews. This is not a church you might want to be in, but one of the the only two that get high praises from Jesus.

Also Pergamon is under high pressure with the throne of Satan himself is in there. They through a lot — even martyrdom — but they allow wrong teaching that leads the people away from God.

In Thyatira the things are even worse: The cause of trouble is the leadership itself.

Sardes is not much better as here the people think they can manage it all without God help and nearly completely fail.

But Philadelphia is without blame. However, not the church you want to join, because on top of all the other problems this church is financially exhausted including their members.

Which leaves us with Laodicea which is the only one that does now receive any kind of praise from Jesus even the church is very impressed by itself.

But Jesus does not give up on them, he gives individual advice, warnings and promises.

### Guidance is ahead ({{% bible val="Chapter 4–5" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation4" %}})

<a name="55b1"></a>
So it’s on you and me and all the church to get up and be ready for the big adventure by looking up.

The solution for all of this is in heaven: The throne room of God where we all have access at any time. It is the place of worship where we find our place in relation to God.

But when you think, sitting and worship will solve all the problems, you are wrong, because worship is so much more: It is full loyalty to God in all aspects of our live. And here we meet Jesus the crucified.

He is our real hero and guide in this huge journey as he is worthy to rule the world. But when we accept and live this we start a journey there is no turning back.

### Evil awakes — join the army ({{% bible val="Chapter 6–7" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation6" %}})

<a name="c33e"></a>
Jesus is not the only one intending to rule this world and Jesus breaks the seals to reveal this. Satan claims the same and shows up in shiny armor, but Jesus shows that behind all this promises lies violence towards people that go along, live threatening injustice as consequence ending up in a total disaster.

Not that the church is excluded from this. No, she is in the middle of it and cries out to God. But we, the church, have to remain until Jesus comes and ends it all.

Until this we need to join the army of God. But what does it looks like? Our fight is not with violence as the devil but it is an army of worshipers that endure anything out of the love for their Lord.

### The first strike ({{% bible val="Chapter 8–9" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation8" %}})

<a name="3037"></a>
It is time for the church to launch its power. With the same force as Jesus as the crucified shakes the world, the prayer of the church does the same. They cause the trumpet sound that shakes the earth. Food, water, trade, security — all is gone. Will this drive the people to look for the real deal. No! The stick to their idols.

They don’t even let loose when their idols turn against them and make them loose hope itself, so that they would rather end their lives but cannot and finally they do it. The church is protected — they will not give up. But the people suffer tremendously but they still stick to their idols.

### Reality check ({{% bible val="Chapter 10" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation10" %}})

<a name="4ab1"></a>
The church failed. Their first strike resulting in nothing but hardened hearts. Hard times alone does not change people. It is the the mystery of God that changes them. And this will be revealed now and it takes some time to digest.

### The big clash ({{% bible val="Chapter 11–13" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation11" %}})

<a name="e39e"></a>
This is the time when we see the material and spiritual world as they really are. First of all: The temple of Gods presence is not a place where we have to gain favor to please God but the place where we show our heart by loving loyal and faithful for him in this world.

The church does not look convincing now. Being witnesses to the world with authority but constantly in defense and finally destroyed. And the whole world celebrates. How can this be?

Because this is not the end. In their deepest and weakest moment the church was victorious. The people needed to see that in times of suffering there is a convincing hope that you can hang on. This is only possible if the church is ready to walk as a witness in difficult times and with this resembles Jesus perfectly: despite authority on the run, finally conquered, resurrected and lifted up.

But can the church we weak when the devil is around. Lets have a look at his achievements:

- He wanted to destroy Jesus — and failed
- Therefore he needed to defend his place in heaven — and was cast out
- He tried to destroy Israel — and failed again
- Finally he persecute the church and imitates God — and becomes a laughing stock

The task is not to defeat the devil — this was done by Jesus — but to draw the people into a relationship with God

### Victory ({{% bible val="Chapter 14–16" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation14" %}})

<a name="37a3"></a>
Jesus victory at the cross and the testimony of the church did it all and the enemy is scattered around. The faithful sing in victory — their only skill required was loyalty to God.

But for the ones that played along with the devil to avoid consequence: You will face no easier consequence now.

It is time to check. The two harvests reveal there the hard reality. Some will be saved others get lost.

And this is the time to Gods zeal steps in. His actions will shake and shake again against false loyalty, attacking his people, hardening of the hearts and the deception of the devil until this kingdom totally collapses.

### The ultimate battle ({{% bible val="Chapter 17–19" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation17" %}})

<a name="517a"></a>
There is one more and a dark mystery that needs to be revealed until the goal is reached. And it becomes very clear that the goal is not to defeat the devil but the union of God with his people.

It is the perfect deception of the church: A beautiful woman blessing the whole world with prosperity. It is ornamented with the jewels of the church and many are part of it. But if you lift the dress it reveals the beast — the strong enforcer of the devil. And this woman is not the bride of Christ but a harlot.

Many are deceived but this perfect charade. This last attack seemed to be perfect. But the opposite is the case. The people are directed by the devil to attack the church are guided by Jesus to destroy the harlot instead.

Now the way is free to finally destroy the devil and his minions.

### A new beginning ({{% bible val="Chapter 20–22" link="https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation20" %}})

<a name="a287"></a>
It is done. Finally! You may have not noticed it but the church was always in power but with a different power and guided the fate of humanity. But first come the final judgment who will join eternity with God and who without him.

After this the bride meets the groom and join him for all eternity.

And, have you understood the story. Than go ahead and live accordingly in your daily life.
