title: "The 70 year weeks"
---


The 70 year weeks are a mysterious part of the Bible with even more interesting interpretations about the end times. Let’s take a closer look at what this is all about.


## What is a year week

<a name="e18f"></a>
During the creation, God sanctified the seventh day as a day of rest, which is called Sabbath, but there was also the law of the “Sabbatical year”: [Every seventh year the land should rest](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Leviticus25%3A1-7) and [the people should live in trust that God would provide for them](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Leviticus25%3A20-22).

But this never seemed to happen, because when Israel [went into exile, there were 70 years that the Sabbatical year did not happen](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/2%20Chronicles36%3A20-21) as prophesied by [Jeremiah](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah25%3A11-12). Since the Sabbatical year occurs only every seventh year, we are talking about a period of 7*70=490 years, the entire time that Israel existed as a nation. So a year or week in Daniel consists of 7 years (it is called a week to show the parallel to the Sabbath day — seventh day in a week).


## The promise

<a name="2d32"></a>
[Counting 605 BC as the year of the first part of the exile](https://seminary.bju.edu/theology-in-3d/so-was-it-70-years-or-not/) brings us to 539 B.C. when Babel was destroyed and [the exile ended under the first Persian king](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/2%20Chronicles36%3A22-23). Daniel was alive at that time and [knew the promise that God had made](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah29%3A10). So [when the time came](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Daniel9%3A1-2) he [prayed a prayer of repentance for his people](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Daniel9%3A3-19). His answer is the explanation of the 70 years, which is only 4 verses, but they take a while to explain them:

“[‘Seventy “sevens” are decreed for your people and your holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the Most Holy Place. 25 ‘Know and understand this: from the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there will be seven “sevens”, and sixty-two “sevens”. It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of trouble. 26 After the sixty-two “sevens”, the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood: war will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed. 27 He will confirm a covenant with many for one “seven”. In the middle of the “seven” he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him.’](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Daniel9%3A24-27)”

70 sevens are the time span of 70*7=490 years, since we are talking about Sabbatical years, which is why Israel had to go into exile.

Verse 24 describes the result of the 490 years:

- For your people and your holy city, to finish transgression. Transgression is a reference to the [Jews who supported Antiochus Epiphanes IV](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Daniel9%3A24-27), described in [chapter 11](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Daniel11%3A32).
- Put and end to sin (literally “seal” which has the same consonants as “remove”) is an ambitious goal.
- Atone for (all) wickedness: atone refers to the [Day of Atonement,](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Leviticus16) which should in the same context was to remove all sins (an eternal atonement).
- Bring in an everlasting righteousness.
- Seal the vision and prophecy: Sealing here means to confirm.
- Anoint the most holy place: the most holy place would be the temple, but maybe this is [Jesus](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Romans3%3A25) who is [greater than the temple](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Matthew12%3A6) and is also anointed.


When we look at this, we see that all of this goes far beyond what we have seen in history and what only Jesus did on the cross: He paid for all sin, gave us His commandments in our hearts with the Holy Spirit, and much more.


## The 70 years

<a name="6576"></a>
So let us break down the rest. The rest of the test breaks the 70 weeks into three parts:

- 7 (decree to build the temple in Jerusalem)
- 62 (temple is built)
- 1 (to finish).


Verse 25: [‘Know and understand this: from the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there will be seven “sevens”, and sixty-two “sevens”. It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of trouble.](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Daniel9%3A24-27)

The word to rebuild Jerusalem went out [through the prophet Jeremiah ](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah30%3A18)in 588/587 during the fall of Jerusalem. This takes the first 7*7 =49 years and ends in 539 when the [Anointed One Cyrus](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Isaiah45%3A1) [issues a decree to rebuild Jerusalem](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/2%20Chronicles36%3A22-23).

Then it takes a while until the temple is rebuilt, which is the year 440 under Nehemiah, and 62*7=434 years pass by when the temple is built and remains but in many troubles as Israel was pushed from the [beginning of the building](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Nehemiah4) through the time of political troubles and changing dominions that ruled of Israel (Persians, Greeks, Syrian-Egyptians, Romans). We are now in the year 6 B.C.



[26 After the sixty-two “sevens”, the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood: war will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed.](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Daniel9%3A24-27)Here the Anointed One is not Cyrus but Jesus who was born in 6 B.C. “Put to death and have nothing” means in the Aramaic text [“cut off”](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/daniel/9-26.htm), which can also mean [“cut a covenant”](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/3772.htm). He died to make a covenant.The people of the ruler refer to emperor Tiberius and his legions. Here the word “Prince” is used (related to the [prince of this world](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/John12%3A31)?). He will come and destroy the city and the sanctuary (temple) in the year 70.The end will come like a flood (of Roman legions), the there will be war until the final war where Israel was deported from Israel in the year 135. The desolation is decreed (by God).



[He will confirm a covenant with many for one “seven”. In the middle of the “seven” he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him.](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Daniel9%3A24-27)Since the last subject is God, He will make a [covenant with many](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Jeremiah31%3A31-34), which is the [new covenant of Jesus](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Hebrews8%3A6).In the middle of the “seven” he will put an end to sacrifice and offering, for [sacrifice is no longer needed](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Hebrews10%3A1-18).He will set up an abomination ([the original does not use “he”, but “one who makes desolate”](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/daniel/9-27.htm)), so here we have a change of subject and back to Tiberius. The original speaks of wings of abomination, referring to the Roman legionary eagle. Until the decreed is poured out on him can be better translated as “until the decreed end is put on the desolator” which means until the Roman Empire falls which brings us [back to Daniel chapter 7](../../../bible/daniel/expl/the-four-kingdoms-in-daniel).The last weekWell, this was a bit complicated when we came to a last week (last seven years). The reason is that some parts describe the end result and there are two stories told in one.The first story is the story of Israel with their Jerusalem and their Temple and their land that comes to an end and is taken up by the New Covenant that Jesus establishes to start over with the Jews.The two stories are shifted by 40 years. How is this possible? Jesus was in the desert for 40 days at the beginning of His ministry and resisted all the temptations that Israel failed to resist in the desert. Therefore, Israel had to wander in the desert for another 40 years before entering the Promised Land.The story of IsraelIn the year 66 the Jewish war begins, which has in the half of the seven years the destruction of the temple, which is not rebuilt. On the wings of the destroyer the temple is destroyed and with it the sacrifices are no longer possible.The war ends in 73 after 7 years and after this, after some unrest, Israel is deported in 135 after another war. Israel lost the temple, the city and the land.The story of Jesus26/7 Jesus is called to His ministry and He makes a [covenant beginning with the Jews](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Matthew15%3A23-24). In the middle of the seven years (year 30) he dies and rises and his covenant now includes the Gentiles. His death ends the sacrifices because they are no longer needed.What happens at the end of the seven years? Since everything else is literary, we would expect this to be exactly 3.5 years. Verse 27 says he makes a covenant for 7 years, but the covenant Jesus started should last until now. So what is missing?I think the second 3.5 years are symbolic for several reasons:They are a parallel to the actions in the Jewish war.No one knows the day and hour of Jesus’ return, the time when everything from verse 24 will be completed.The church was to follow Jesus in everything He did, so since Jesus was there for 3.5 years, the church was to do the same, so the same time frame is used.Dig deeperWuppertaler Studienbibel, Der Prophet Daniel, pages 334–354
