title: "The answer to all questions"

How should all the challenges of the churches be answered? What is the plan of action that God will take? It is simple: God is not doing anything, he is resting in worship and that is where we need to start.


## Our text

<a name="8bf5"></a>
We are now in [chapter 4](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation4).


## What is worship?

<a name="0b7d"></a>
How can worship be the answer? What is it that we fail to understand? Worship is focusing on God and beginning to see our lives from His perspective.

It is a place where you put your trust in him above all else. And it is a place where you put your life completely in his hands so that he can lead it wherever he wants.

Worship is rooted in prayer, where we experience God’s goodness as He answers our prayers, which leads to trust in His character and thus a longing to be like Him — we imitate what we worship. And that is the beginning of our transformation.

It is a place of intense relationship with God.

- As we worship and get to know God better, we are unlikely to fall into false doctrine.
- The place of worship is the place where we are reminded that God cares for us, which gives us rest in trouble and persecution, but also makes us live and care for others, especially knowing that they do not have such a refuge.



## The base

<a name="91eb"></a>
The place of worship is the throne room. God rules and receives unchanging worship. This is an unchanging, eternal reality. And this is about to extend to the earth. If you read carefully, you will see that all the seals, trumpets, and bowls that are there come from the throne room.

But how does this relate to worship? Did you notice the rainbow in this chapter? There are several other indicators that everything that comes out of there is based on grace and mercy.

So let’s see how this works.
