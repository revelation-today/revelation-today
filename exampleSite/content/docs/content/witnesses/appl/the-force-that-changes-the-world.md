title: "The force that changes the world"

There are two witnesses who change the whole world and prepare it for the kingdom of God. Who are they and what is their secret?


## Our text

We are moving quickly forward and reached [chapter 11](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Revelation11).


## The temple

<a name="5a8c"></a>
The first thing we need to understand (about the scroll) is the temple. The temple is a picture of God’s presence. In the Old Testament it was the Garden of Eden or a building, but in the New Testament it could be [Jesus](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/John2%3A19-21) or the [Church](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/1%20Corinthians3%3A17). While in the Old Testament the main purpose is to offer sacrifices [this is no longer necessary](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Hebrews10%3A1-18). Instead, what God wants is worshipers. We are to be faithful to God. What this means is shown by the two witnesses.


## The witnesses

<a name="3221"></a>
I make this short: [The two witnesses are the church](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Hebrews10%3A1-18).

The two witnesses following the lifestyle of Jesus:

- They act humbly
- They act in authority
- They die where Jesus died.
- People are relieved when they die.
- They resurrect
- They ascend to heaven


This is not a literal imitation of Jesus, but the church should go the way that Jesus went. The church member doesn’t have to die of persecution, but we should be willing to give up our lives.

And just as Jesus’ death on the cross looks like a defeat, so it was not for the Church. The beast can only overcome them when they have finished their testimony, and their death itself will be the greatest testimony (there may even be a parallel to [Samson](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/Judges16%3A30)).

The two witnesses are modeled after Moses (water to blood) and Elijah (no rain, fire from heaven). But all the signs and authority did not make a difference as they did in the time of Moses and Elijah. The change came when they died and God resurrected them. When they died and God sanctified them, the majority of the people really turned their lives over to God.Does this mean that when all the people die from persecution, God will resurrect them and take them up to heaven? We need to look at this picture a little more broadly. There is a saying: The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church. We don’t have to save our lives to be a witness. The Church will continue even if we leave. God will call us when the time comes.


### Reflection

<a name="06e1"></a>
<li id="5ae6">Why do you have time with God? What do you expect from it?</li><li id="125b">How much time do you spend with God when it is about you and the people around you? How much time is it? God, do with me what you want, where do you want to send me, how can I glorify you?</li><li id="7490">How do you feel when people mock Jesus? What do you do? How do you respond?</li><li id="31f3">Can you be humble and admit your mistakes as a Christian when the world mocks Jesus and the church? How can you be stronger in such a situation?</li><li id="2aa5">Do you still believe in God’s power and supernatural intervention? Have you seen it make a difference?</li><li id="8d46">Have you experienced healing and restoration that came not through prayer or preaching, but in an unspectacular way?</li><li id="d815">How far would you go for Jesus? What would happen if you were killed for your faith?</li><li id="d3a0">Do you think your witness is complete when you die? What part of the Church depends on you alone?</li><li id="61be">The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church. Do you believe this?</li><li id="c094">Can you think of examples where this has happened?</li><li id="45d3">Can you see a parallel between the two witnesses and how the early church functioned?</li><li id="0fe9">What is more important to you than your own life?</li><li id="63f5">Do you believe that the Church has the potential to change the world?</li>
