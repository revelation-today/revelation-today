There is a small scroll that John has to eat and the mystery of the seven thunders. What is the meaning of this?


## The motivation

After the sixth trumpet, it looks like nothing is going to rescue the people from the demons that are destroying them. As a result, we have a longer interlude between the sixth and seventh trumpets, which come at the end of chapter 11. This connects chapters 10 and 11.

Something else must be needed to turn people away from their own disaster, and that is the faithful testimony of the church — represented by the witnesses who have their source in the worship of God.


## The angel with the scroll

To make this possible, an angel appears on a white cloud. Whether it is Jesus Himself or an angel representing Him: This is connected with Jesus. Also, the existence of a scroll links to the event in chapter 5 where Jesus opened a scroll.

This scroll is not the same as the one in chapter 5, but it is related to it. Here it is called a smaller scroll and was to be eaten by John/the church and be a witness — there it is just a scroll and is to be opened by Jesus to expose Satan.

The connection is that Jesus defeated Satan on the cross, which is the main part. But there is still something (small) for the church to do. This is essential to fulfill God’s plan.

As assurance, the angel puts one foot on the sea and one on the land, showing that he rules over them (in chapter 13, the two beasts that come out of them), so the church has nothing to fear.

And then there are the seven thunders that speak. We are very curious as to what they say, but they are sealed. So, sorry, we can speculate what it would be, but we will not find out until God reveals it.


## Eating the scroll

John is asked to eat this scroll. This reminds us of Ezekiel and his eating of the scroll. He had to assimilate the message that he would later preach. This is the same for John. He makes this scroll his own. What is the content?

It describes what Jesus has done (sweet in the mouth) and what the consequences are (bitter in the stomach), which is the judgment for the world, but much more, what not to do to give witness to the world that hates them and will not threaten them better than Jesus.

But what is the scroll now? Looking at the next chapter(s), it is the testimony of the Church to reach the nations, which the Church will finally accomplish.
