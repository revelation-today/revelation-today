title: "A real hero"

What is a hero? Usually a person of destruction. What should a hero be? What does the Bible say about it?


## The two kingdoms

<a name="c73c"></a>
There are two realms defined by lack or abundance. Some people call them the realm of beggars and of kings.


## The kingdom of lacking

<a name="a9fd"></a>
In the realm of lack, people have limited resources. If you have something, no one else can have it. This leads to the pursuit of all resources by any means necessary: survival of the fittest, manipulation, fear, greed, unforgiveness, bitterness.

People in this realm may be kind people, but their answers are to restrict (imprison, brainwash) or destroy (kill) evil people. Their heroes are those who are stronger than the wicked and kill or bind them.

The problem is that there is no clear line between good and evil, so even the heroes have one foot on the evil side. So the key here is balance: Don’t be too good and don’t be too bad. Make peace with your greed and abuse, because resources are limited, so what can you do? In addition, you cannot be merciful to your enemy and he may recover and destroy you.


## The realm of abundance

<a name="563c"></a>
In the realm of abundance, there is no limit to the resources that create and atmosphere or sharing, caring, loving, building and supporting. If I give you what I have, I will get what I need from somewhere else — maybe with a delay. The [story of the long spoons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_long_spoons) shows how this can work.

So the answer to evil is different than in the other realm. Here, dealing with evil people is to restore them, especially if they come from the other realm. It is about building trust, teaching boundaries (manipulation is not allowed), and healing inner wounds.

It is ok here that heroes are not perfect, as they can also heal while helping others.

The work here is to learn and increase trust and learn to give and love.


## A real hero

<a name="509d"></a>
To be a hero is not to be weak and to let everyone take advantage of you and to always smile and turn the other cheek.

The power of a hero is love. This does not mean being emotionally romantic, but it is [very practical in how you treat others](https://www.bibleserver.com/NIV/1%20Corinthians13%3A4-8). And it is a choice because it is a risk because you can be hurt and your goodness can be abused.

That is why love requires being able to set boundaries, because love hopes for the best but can handle the worst.

If you look at Jesus as an example, you will find all this. He loved and cared, but he also set boundaries and confronted some people (very often self-righteous and proud people). But can his life be seen as a victory since he was crucified in the end?

Only if we see him as a simple hero, but he was a superhero. Let me explain the difference: A hero, often an underdog, is not much stronger than the villain, so he has to protect himself, grow, wait for the right moment, find the weakness of his opponent and strike at the right moment, maybe at a moment of enlightenment.

But a superhero is different: he does not have to worry about protecting himself and finding his opponent’s weaknesses. Jesus took off his armor, let the devil throw the first punch, and beat him to death. But guess what, Jesus was not defeated. He rose from the dead and overcame the devil. This is what a superhero does.

He has the potential to heal and restore evil people because he is not afraid to be destroyed. He can share because he knows he is cared for.

Jesus took off his armour, allowed the devil to make the first punch and beat him even to death. But, guess what, Jesus was not defeated. He rose from the death and so overcame the devil. That is what a superhero does.

He has the potential to heal and restore evil people as he is not afraid to get destroyed. He can share because he knows he is provided for
