title: "How to study the Book of Revelation"
---


When you want to study the book of Revelation, it is hard to know where to start. There is so much material and so many different views. How do you begin? This guide will give you some direction. I will try to make things as transparent as possible so that you can also look at other views.


## Principles of the interpretation

<a name="a5fe"></a>
I try to make these articles not abstract but applicable to daily life, not as a list of instructions but more like awareness and guiding questions. Sorry, life is not that easy and you need the guidance of the Holy Spirit ;-)

I donâ€™t claim to present the one and only truth about Revelation. This is the view that I have developed over several decades and I am still learning. So please feel free to challenge my arguments. If you have a good point, I will be happy to adjust the articles.

In my argumentation I try to be as transparent as possible and will not use power arguments (great and famous preacher x said so, so it must be true), but go with the following priorities

- What the Bible says to understand a passage
- Literature background: Read a letter differently than a prophetic book
- Historical background to better understand the daily life of the people
- References to Jewish or non-biblical Christian literature



## The materials

<a name="51f8"></a>
My desire is that you be able to have this as a self-study. Therefore, I have tried to make as much of the material directly available as possible. So the main arguments are summarized in the articles with Bible references. Historical references I have tried to link to free web resources.

More complex Bible references are found in literature that you need to buy, where I have tried to keep this to a minimum so that you can afford to buy them.

In the [reference articles](../../../gen/index/expl/overview-on-the-book-of-revelation/index.html) you will find links to the respective sources. My job was just to read through them, choose the right material, and make an easy-to-read summary.


## Key books

<a name="3309"></a>

### G. K. Beale: Revelation

<a name="7557"></a>
[This is a main reference but a 1000 pager](https://www.logos.com/product/3467/the-book-of-revelation). There is much more in there than I refer to. I am not agree with everything but follow mainly his argumentation. He goes deep into grammar and other texts. If this is to detailed you can also go for [the smaller version](https://www.hugendubel.de/de/taschenbuch/g_k_beale_david_campbell-revelation_a_shorter_commentary-22090575-produkt-details.html?affId=3048435&amp;tduid=8f4bdc9f4e3da77eb0c918bfb1c8e410&amp;utm_source=trd&amp;utm_medium=af&amp;partner=tradedoubler&amp;utm_campaign=Redbrain+DE&amp;adCode=920R20D30I20L&amp;utm_content=Lkg).


### Richard Bauckham: The theology of the book of Revelation

<a name="aff4"></a>
[This is a very condense and useful reference](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/271806). Rather easy to read and full of insights.


## Good to read additionally

<a name="3d73"></a>

### David Aune: Revelation

<a name="1483"></a>
[This is a huge work](https://www.logos.com/product/208586/revelation-3-vols) and also not cheap, but gives a lot of historical background, many theological positions and thorough grammatical analysis. It is sometimes hard to read and there is not always an answer on difficult passage but leaves the answer open. Definitely not to start with but an extensive library.


### Michael Goreman: Reading Revelation Responsible

<a name="1f44"></a>
[This is a good resource ](https://www.logos.com/product/121427/reading-revelation-responsibly-uncivil-worship-and-witness?campaignid=18467614226&amp;adgroupid=142254630185&amp;keyword=&amp;device=m&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=advertising_cpc&amp;utm_campaign=google_search-keyword_dsa_logos_de_en&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8OmdBhAgEiwAShr406IHCnZ9JreBUdDWS8tQrGegLBhyy8dgabdZmygZ4DCZb_yOlogPpxoCW9YQAvD_BwE)to get an understanding of the literature type of the book


### Richard Bauckham: The climax of prophecy

<a name="810b"></a>
[A very good reading but again](https://www.logos.com/product/168132/climax-of-prophecy-studies-on-the-book-of-revelation), not as a starter. He looks on different topics throughout the Revelation and brings in a lot of background knowledge.


### Gordon Fee: Revelation

<a name="7b1c"></a>
[A good book](https://www.perlego.com/book/878981/revelation-pdf), but not really a main source of content for me.


## Complementing topics

<a name="a339"></a>

### David Dorsey: The literary structure of the Old Testament

<a name="e777"></a>
[A great book](https://www.logos.com/product/39605/the-literary-structure-of-the-old-testament-a-commentary-on-genesis-malachi) about how to read literature in Hebrew.


### G.K.Beale, Kim Mitchell: God dwells among us

<a name="c2e0"></a>
[A great book](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/G-K-Beale-ebook/dp/B095BL9G66) about the topic of the temple


### Nahum Sarna: Understanding Genesis

<a name="1492"></a>
If you want to know more about the creation story. [He wrote a good book with lots of background information](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Nahum-M-Sarna/dp/0805210636).


### Nahum Sarna: Exodus

<a name="980d"></a>
If you want to step deeper into the understanding of Exodus. [He wrote an interesting book](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Genesis-Heritage-Biblical-Israel/dp/0805202536).


### Barbara R. Rossing: The Rapture Exposed

<a name="c781"></a>
This is critical [evaluation of the rapture and a reflection of its consequences](https://www.amazon.de/Rapture-Exposed-Message-Hope-Revelation/dp/0813343143).
