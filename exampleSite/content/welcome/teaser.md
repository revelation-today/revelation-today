## The problem

In today's world we are overwhelmed by 
- lots of new information that we need to process
- ethical and political questions that are hard to answer
- new technologies which clamour for our attention

and we can struggle to find guidance and motivation in the Bible. In particular, it's hard to see how the Book of Revelation could be a tool help us navigate modern life.

## The solution?

Of all the books of the Bible, the Book of Revelation is particularly strange and hard to understand. It is full of apocalyptic events and strange pictures e.g.
- the number of the beast: 666
- the four horsemen
- a book with seven seals
- a mark on hand and forehead
- angels of churches
- Armageddon
- the 1000-year kingdom
- etc.

Perhaps you have not yet heard a good sermon on this book, if any. At times it certainly does not seem to be relevant to the world today.

## A different view

However, this is not the case at all. This book is meant to be a help for Christians and to give orientation to anyone who is
- under persecution
- in poverty
- experiencing bad leadership
- suffering under wrong teaching
- missing the guidance and power of the Holy Spirit

The book of Revelation was one of the most widely read books in the early Church as it helped Christians to navigate the challenges arising from the oppression and deception of the Roman Empire. The book is equally relevant today.

This book is a comfort and encouragement
- in a deceptive and fallen world
- for churches that have lost their focus
- if you have personally lost the sense of what is really important in your faith
- as it advises the Church how to make a difference in this world

Its core subject is not about future disasters, but about Jesus and the worship of Him.
