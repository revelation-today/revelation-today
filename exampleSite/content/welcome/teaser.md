## The problem

In today's world we are overwhelmed by 
- new information that we need to process
- ethical and political questions that are hard to answer
- new technologies which request our attention

It is therefore sometimes hard to find guidance and motivation in the Bible.

## The solution?

Of all the books of the Bible the Book of Revelation is particularily strange and hard to understand. It is full of apocalyptic events and strange pictures e.g.
- the number of the beast: 666
- the four horsemen
- a book with seven seals
- a mark on hand and forehead
- angels of churches
- armageddon
- the 1000 years kingdom
- ...

You may have not even heard a good sermon on this book, if any and at times it certainly does not seem to be relevant to the world today

## A different view

However this is not the case at all. This book is meant to be a help for Christians and to give orientation to those 
- under persecution, 
- in poverty, 
- with bad leadership, 
- suffering under wrong teaching
- missing the Holy Spirit

It was one of the most read books in the early Church, which helped them to navigate through the challenge of the oppression and deception of the Roman Empire and is equally relevant today.

This book is a comfort and encouragement
- in a deceptive and fallen world
- for churches that have lost their focus
- if you have personally lost the sense of what is really important in your faith
- how the church makes a difference in this world

It's core subject is not about future disasters, but about Jesus and the worship of Him.
