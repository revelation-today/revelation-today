## The problem

In todays world we are overwhelmed by 
- new information that we need to process
- ethical and political questions that are hard ot answer
- new technologies which request our attention

and it is sometimes hard to find guidance and motivation in the Bible.

## The solution?

From all the books of the Bible the Book of Revelation is particularily strange and hard to understand. It is full of disasters and strange pictures
- the number of the beast: 666
- the four horsemen
- a book with seven seals
- a mark on hand and forehead
- angels of churches
- armageddon
- the 1000 years kingdom, when beheaded people rule
- ...

You may have not even heard a good sermon on this sermon, if any and this book does not seem to be relevant to you at all in your situation.

## A different view

But this is not the case at all. This book gives orientation for Christians 
- under persecution, 
- in poverty, 
- with bad leadership, 
- suffering under wrong teaching
- missing the Holy Spirit

And it was one of the most red books in the Early Christianity, that helped them to navigate through the challenge of the oppression and deception of the Roman Empire and is fully relevant today.

This book is a comfort and encouragement
- in a deceptive and fallen world
- for churches that lost their drive
- if you lost the sense what is really important in your faith
- how the church makes a difference in this world

And the center is not future disasters, but Jesus and the worship of him.

## The journey

But in order to reap the benfits of this book I invite you on a journey where
- you read through the lenses of the first readers
- you get to understand all the unusual pictures
- see solid argumentations from top theologians
- see the relevance for our time
- find encouragement 
- see concrete application
