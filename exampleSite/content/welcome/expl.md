We will guide you through the explanations.

This gives you a more detailed explanation to why I think this is a good understanding. You see at the end of most pages a link where I reference great theologians and their contribution to the Book of Revelation. 

If you are not satisfied with the description there you can dive into these books (I tried to keep the number of book small) and get more detailed information from there.

This will take you about 6 hours if you want to read it through. If you want to check all the bible verse it will take a bit longer.
