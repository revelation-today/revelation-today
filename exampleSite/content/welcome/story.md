This will guide you through the story of Revelation. It will give you a quick overview of what this book is all about.

It won't take long to read - you will be done in a few minutes.

# How everything started

In the beginning everything was good. God created everything perfectly, and installed Adam in the Garden Eden as governor over it all.

Really, was everything good? Well, one thing was not good and this was that man was alone. So, God created Adam’s counterpart: Eve. Things then were very good.

However Adam started to love the things God had given him more than God himself and his relationship with God broke fell apart.

Adam and his descendants were banished from the Garden and so they decided to build towns and settle down. However, God still longed for fellowship with man, so he singled out Abraham to be his earthly companion. Abraham chose to live in relationship with God and he chose God over the gift of Isaac, his long-awaited son.

And out of Abraham he made the people of Israel. 

# The promise

With Israel things seem to change, but the question remain: Would they love God’s gifts more than God and fail again? 

And so the covenant between God and man had broken down because the majority of people turned their backs on God.

But there was a promise of a Redeemer who would come to set up an eternal kingdom for every person who wants to join.

# New beginnings ({{% bible val="Chapter 1" link="rev:1" lang="en" %}})

Did you hear the news? It is true. The kingdom that we are awaited it here! It has arrived and we are kings and priests. 

It would be time to celebrate but there is an important task at hand, that can not wait. 

We see in a breathtaking vision what is the purpose of the church: To be light of the world while being fully dependent on Jesus. There is nothing more expected from the church, but also nothing less.

The question is: Is the church ready for this?

# A grand disaster ({{% bible val="Chapter 2-3" link="rev:2-3" lang="en" %}})

Let’s look at the church. 

We start with Ephesus, the hard-working church. They work, endure, and keep the teachings of Jesus, but the main thing is missing: love, the reason why they exist. This church has no purpose and in this stage if would be better she would not exist!

But the next church is very different: Smyrna. This is a small town, overwhelmed by an ungodly society, the church is being persecuted and hated by the Jews. This is not a church you might want to be in, but one of the only two that receive high praises from Jesus.

Also, Pergamon is under high pressure as the throne of Satan himself is in there. They go through a great deal—even martyrdom—but they allow wrong teaching and that leads the people away from God.

In Thyatira things are even worse. Here, the cause of the trouble is the leadership itself.

Sardes is not much better. This congregation think they can manage it all without God’s help and they nearly always completely fail.

The church at Philadelphia is without blame. However, this is still not the church you’d want to join, because on top of all the other problems, the members of this church are financially exhausted.

This leaves us with Laodicea which is the only church that receives any kind of praise from Jesus. Even the church is very impressed by itself. 

Yet Jesus does not give up on them; instead he gives individual advice, warnings and promises.

# Guidance is ahead ({{% bible val="Chapter 4-5" link="rev:4-5" lang="en" %}})

So, it’s up to you and me and rest of the Church to get up and get ready for the big adventure. Things must change, but how?

Jesus wants us to look up. The solution is in heaven: the throne room of God. It is the place of worship where we find our place in relation to God, and we all have access to it at any time.

But if you think that worhsipping (in the throne room) will solve all the problems, you are wrong. 
Look around: Worship is so much more as you think: It is laying down your crown, the expression of full loyalty to God in all aspects of our lives. And here we meet Jesus the Crucified.

He is our real hero and guide throughout this huge journey. He is worthy to rule the world. 
But we should understand that when we accept his invitation, we start a journey and there is no turning back.

# Evil awakes - you need to join the army ({{% bible val="Chapter 6-7" link="rev:6-7" lang="en" %}})

Jesus breaks the seals to reveal that he is not the only one who intends to rule our world. Satan claims the same position and he shows up in shiny armor. 
Yet, Jesus shows us that behind all Satan’s promises lie violence towards the people who go along with him. 
Jesus wants us to live for him and to overcome injustice because the consequence of not doing that is total disaster. 

Already, there is so much suffering in the world. The Church is right in the middle of the chaos and cries out to God. 
But we, the Church, must remain steady until Jesus comes and ends it all.

Until this happens, we need to actively fight in the army of God. What does this look like? 
Our fight is not with violence (like the devil’s tactics); instead we fight as an army of worshipers that endures anything out of the love for their Lord.

# The first strike ({{% bible val="Chapter 8-9" link="rev:8-9" lang="en" %}})

It is time for the Church to launch its power with the same force as Jesus. 
Just as the Crucified shakes the world, the prayer of the Church does the same, and they cause the trumpet sound that shakes the earth. 
When food, water, trade, security is all gone, will this drive the people to look for the real deal? No! They continue to stick to their idols.

They don’t even let go when their idols turn against them and take away their hope, so that they would rather end their lives. 
Even though the lost suffer tremendously, they still stick to their idols.

# Reality check ({{% bible val="Chapter 10" link="rev:10" lang="en" %}})

The Church has failed. Their first strike resulted in nothing but hardened hearts. Hard times alone do not change people. 

It is the mystery of God that changes them. And this will be revealed now—although it will take some time for us to digest.

# The big clash ({{% bible val="Chapter 11-13" link="rev:11-13" lang="en" %}})

This is the time when we see the material and spiritual world as they really are. 
Firstly, the temple of God’s presence is not a place where we have to gain favor to please God but it is the place where we show our heart by loving him and staying loyal and faithful to him in this world.

The Church does not look convincing now. It witnesses to the world with authority but is constantly in defence and is finally destroyed. 
And the whole world celebrates. How can this be?

And yet, this is not the end. In their deepest and weakest moment, the church was victorious. 
The people needed to see that in times of suffering we have a convincing hope and they too can hang on to this. 
This is only possible if the church is ready to walk as a witness in difficult times and through this we’ll resemble Jesus perfectly: 
despite authority on the run, it finally conquers, is resurrected, and lifted up.

But what happens when the Church is weak when the devil is around? Let’s have a look at his achievements:
- He wanted to destroy Jesus—and failed.
- He tried to defend his place in heaven—and was cast out.
- He tried to destroy Israel—and failed again.
- Finally, he decides to persecute the Church and imitate God—and becomes a laughing stock.

Our task is not to defeat the devil—this was done by Jesus—but to draw the people into a relationship with God.

# Victory ({{% bible val="Chapter 14-16" link="rev:14-16" lang="en" %}})

Jesus’ victory at the Cross and the testimony of the Church did it all and now the enemy is scattered around. 
The faithful sing in victory — the only skill they required was loyalty to God.

But for the ones that played along with the devil to avoid the consequences, they will face a worse consequence now.

It is time to check. The two harvests reveal the hard reality: some will be saved and others are lost.

This is the time for God’s zeal steps in. 
His actions will shake and shake again until the kingdom of the devil collapses. They target false loyalty, attacks against his people, hardening of the hearts and the deception of the devil.

# The ultimate battle ({{% bible val="Chapter 17-19" link="rev:17-19" lang="en" %}})

There is one more dark mystery that needs to be revealed before the goal is reached. 
And it becomes very clear that this goal is not to defeat the devil but to ensure the union of God with his people.

It is the perfect deception, and many in the Church fall for it: A beautiful woman blesses the whole world with prosperity. 
She is ornamented with the jewels of the Church, but if you take away the dress the beast is revealed—the strong enforcer of the devil. 
This woman is not the bride of Christ but a harlot!

Many are deceived by this perfect charade. 
This last attack seems to be perfect, but the opposite is the case: the people who are directed by the devil to attack the Church are actually being guided by Jesus to destroy the harlot instead.

Now the way is free to finally destroy the devil and his minions.

# A new beginning ({{% bible val="Chapter 20-22" link="rev:20-22" lang="en" %}})

It is done. Finally! You may have not noticed it but the church was always in power but with a different power and guided the fate of humanity. 
But first come the final judgment who will join eternity with God and who without him.

After this the bride meets the groom and join him for all eternity.

And, have you understood the story. Than go ahead and live accordingly in your daily life.
